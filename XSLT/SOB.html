         <emph class="speaker">ANNOUNCER</emph> The Petri family -- the family that took time to bring you
         good wine -- invites you to listen to 
         <emph class="mention">Dr. Watson</emph> tell us
         another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective,
         
         <emph class="mention">Sherlock Holmes</emph>. And you know something? I had an
         adventure tonight I wish you could have shared with me. I had a steak about, oh, an
         inch
         and a half thick, tender and juicy, and with it I had a glass of Petri California
         Burgundy. Now there's a combination -- steak and Petri Burgundy. That Petri Burgundy
         is
         a perfect mealtime wine. It's a rich, red wine that's hearty and full of flavor --
         flavor that comes right from the heart of the grape. And don't think that Petri Burgundy
         is only good with steak -- it'll make a hamburger sandwich taste like a feast, too.
         Try
         Petri Burgundy with any meat or meat dish. It's just wonderful! And serve it proudly,
         too, because after all, the name Petri is the proudest name in the history of American
         wines.</p>

         gloves. Slip 'em off and come and join me by the fire.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">ANNOUNCER</emph> Thanks, doctor. Quite a nip in the air tonight.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Yes, there is indeed.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">ANNOUNCER</emph> Well, doctor, you told us last week that tonight's story
         centered around the activities of a brilliant and beautiful woman.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Yes, my boy. Her name was Irene Adler. But I never
         knew
         <emph class="mention"> Holmes</emph> to refer to her by any other name than
         "The Woman."</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">ANNOUNCER</emph> She sounds mighty intriguing. How did you happen to meet up
         with her?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Well, I'll tell you the story from the beginning. One night --
         it was on the twentieth of March, Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Eight, to be exact --
         I
         was returning home from a visit to a patient, when my steps led me through Baker Street.
         Since my marriage, I hadn't seen much of 
         <emph class="mention">Sherlock Holmes</emph>
         and--</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">ANNOUNCER</emph> You couldn't resist stopping by Two-Twenty-One B, I'm sure,
         doctor.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Of course I couldn't. As I stood outside the well-remembered
         door, I looked up at the lighted windows and saw the tall, spare figure of my old
         friend
         pass twice in dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,
         eagerly, with his head sunk on his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me,
         who
         knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was
         hot
         on the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and a few moments later, found myself
         standing before him.

      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph>
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">FADES IN</emph> Marriage suits you,
         <emph class="mention">
            Watson</emph>. You look in splendid shape.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Yes,
         <emph class="mention"> Holmes</emph>, I'm feeling very
         well, thanks.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> And in practice again, I see. You didn't tell me that you'd
         gone back into harness.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph>
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">SURPRISED</emph> Oh? How do you know?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Elementary, my dear chap. If a gentleman walks into my rooms
         smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver on his right forefinger
         and
         a bulge on the left side of his hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope,
         I
         should be dull, indeed, if I didn't pronounce him to be an active member of the medical
         profession.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph>
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">CHUCKLES</emph> Same as ever,
         <emph class="mention">
            Holmes</emph>. By the way, I'm, uh-- I'm not interrupting you, am I?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Yes, you are, old fellow, but it's a most welcome
         interruption.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> You're working on a new case?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> It looks like it. This letter arrived by the last post today.
         It's undated, and has neither signature nor address. Read it.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph>
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">MUMBLES</emph> Let's have a look. 
         <emph class="stageDirect">READS</emph>
         "There will call upon you tonight, at a quarter to eight o'clock, a gentleman who
         desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services
         to
         one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted.
         This account of you we have from all quarters received." 
         <emph class="stageDirect">TO
            HIMSELF</emph> Hm! 
         <emph class="stageDirect">READS</emph> "Be in your chamber,
         then, at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask."
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">TO HOLMES</emph> Great Scott, it all sounds very mysterious.
         What do you imagine it means?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Look carefully at the note,
         <emph class="mention">
            Watson</emph>. What do you deduce from it?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Oh, let's see. Well, the man who wrote it was presumably
         well-to-do. Such paper couldn't be bought for under half a crown a packet. And it's
         peculiarly strong and stiff.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Peculiar -- that's the very word. It's not an English paper at
         all. Hold it up to the light. You notice anything?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Yes. There's a large "E" with a small "g"--</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph>
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">AGREES</emph> Mm hm.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> --and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of
         the paper.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> What does that suggest to you?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> The name of the maker, no doubt; or perhaps his monogram.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Not at all, my dear fellow. The "G" with the small "t" stands
         for "Gesellschaft," which is the German for "Company."</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> And the "E - g"? </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> That stands for Egria. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Egria?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> It's in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from
         Carlsbad. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> So the paper was made in Bohemia. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Undoubtedly. And the man who wrote the note is a German.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> How do you know that?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Observe the curious construction of the sentence, "This
         account of you we have from all quarters received." A Frenchman or a Russian could
         not
         have written that. It's the German who is so discourteous to his verbs.</p>

      <p>

         I the honor to address?</p>
      <p>

      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> How do you do, sir?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">KING</emph> You must excuse this mask that I wear. The august person who
         employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the
         title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> I was well aware of that fact, sir. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">KING</emph> You see, 
         <emph class="mention">Mr. Holmes</emph>, the matter
         I am about to discuss implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of
         Bohemia.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> That had not escaped me either, sir. In fact, if you will
         state your case, I shall be better able to advise you -- your Majesty.</p>

         <emph class="stageDirect">DECISIVELY</emph> Yes. Yes, I am the King. Why should I attempt
         to conceal it?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Why, indeed?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">KING</emph> I shall remove the mask.

         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Then, pray consult. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">KING</emph> Briefly, the facts are these. Some five years ago, during a
         visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene
         Adler.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Irene Adler? We know of her, your Majesty.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Look her up in the index for me, will you,

      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">KING</emph> I imagined that her name would not be unfamiliar to you. </p>

      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">KING</emph> Well, I am about to be married to the second daughter of the

         suburbia, but tells us very little about the owner. I think a visit to the local public
         house might prove more instructive. Come on, old chap. I see the door of the Coach

         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Well,
         <emph class="mention"> Holmes</emph>, now that we've
         eaten, perhaps you'll tell me your plan.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> With pleasure, my dear fellow -- and while I'm so doing, I'll
         proceed with applying the makeup for my new disguise.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph>
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">AMUSED</emph> Another disguise? What's it to be this time?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> I think the character and appearance of an amiable,
         simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman would be the most suited to my plan for entering
         Miss Adler's house.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> You're going to try and enter, then? </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> I must, my dear fellow. I'm sure the photograph is there. Miss
         Adler -- or, rather, Mrs. Norton -- will return from her drive in the park at
         six-thirty. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> And what then?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> You must leave that to me. I've already made my arrangements.
         There is only one point on which I must insist -- you must not interfere, come what
         may.
         You understand?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> I'm to remain neutral?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Yes. There will be some small unpleasantness. Don't join in.
         It will end in my being conveyed into the house. As soon as I am able to, I shall
         open
         one of the windows. You are to watch from outside. When I raise my hand, you will
         throw
         an object -- that I shall give you -- through the window and, at the same time, cry
         "Fire!" You follow me?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Entirely. But what am I to throw? </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Oh, it's nothing very formidable. Here it is. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Huh. Looks like a great big cigar. What is it?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> An ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at
         either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to throwing it through
         the
         window. When you raise the cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
         You may then walk to the end of the street, and I'll rejoin you in ten minutes. I
         hope
         I've made myself clear.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Perfectly. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> Good. And now, old fellow, as soon as I've donned my clerical

         Remember, the king told us it was a large, framed picture. And also remember that
         she
         planned to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands on it.
         It
         must be inside her house.</p>

         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Well, I'm still in the dark.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> There's no mystery, old chap. When my accomplices started the
         row in the street, I had a little moist red paint in my hand. My good friend Alfie
         pretended to strike me; I clapped my hand to my head and fell down. It's an old
         trick.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Yes, I understand that, but how did my throwing the rocket
         help you?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> It was all-important, my dear fellow. When a woman thinks her
         house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush for the thing that she values most.
         A
         married woman grabs her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. In this
         case,
         of course, it was the photograph.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Where was it?</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> In a recess in the living room, just above the right-hand
         bell-pull. I caught a glimpse of it as she drew it out. When I made it known that
         the
         fire was a false alarm, she replaced the photograph. As soon as I was able to, I advised
         her that I was feeling well enough to leave.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> You didn't take the photograph, then.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">HOLMES</emph> No, I felt that over-precipitance at this stage might ruin
         everything.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> What do we do now? </p>
      <p>

         <emph class="speaker">ANNOUNCER</emph> Petri California Port is some wine! Boy, that Petri family
         really knows how to make good wine, all right. And no wonder. Look at all the experience
         they've had. Ever since they started the Petri business, way back in the eighteen
         hundreds, the Petri family has handed down from father to son -- from father to son
         --
         the art of selecting perfect, sun-ripened California grapes and making them into clear,
         fragrant, delicious wine. Those letters -- P-E-T-R-I -- on the label of every bottle
         of
         Petri wine are the personal assurance of the Petri family that every drop of wine
         in
         that bottle is good wine. It's got to be! Because Petri took time to bring you good
         wine. 
         <emph class="stageDirect">TO WATSON</emph> Well, 
         <emph class="mention">Dr.
            Watson</emph>, that was a great story you told us tonight.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> I thought you'd like it, Mr. Bartell. That's why I plan to
         tell you a sequel to it next week.</p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">ANNOUNCER</emph> A sequel? Say, that sounds exciting, doctor. </p>
      <p>
         <emph class="speaker">WATSON</emph> Oh, I think you'll find it proves to be, Mr. Bartell. It's a
         story that takes place twenty years after tonight's adventure. Once again, the principal
         part is played by a woman. Only in this case, it isn't Irene Adler. It's her daughter.
         
         <emph class="stageDirect">BEAT</emph> Oh, and, uh, now, Mr. Bartell, before I go I want to
         remind our listeners that they owe a real debt of gratitude to the Selective Service
         Boards in their communities. At this moment, the Selective Service Boards are working
         harder than ever, making sure that every returning veteran knows his rights and
         privileges. And the Boards are helping him take full advantage of those rights and
         privileges. They're helping our veterans get jobs. Our Selective Service Boards deserve
         our sincere thanks and they deserve our cooperation. They have done -- and they are
         doing -- a splendid job.</p>
