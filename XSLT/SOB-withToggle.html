      <div><em class="announcer">ANNOUNCER</em> The Petri family -- the family that took time to bring you
         good wine -- invites you to listen to <em class="mention">Dr. Watson</em> tell us
         another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective,
         <em class="mention">Sherlock Holmes</em>. And you know something? I had an
         adventure tonight I wish you could have shared with me. I had a steak about, oh, an
         inch
         and a half thick, tender and juicy, and with it I had a glass of Petri California
         Burgundy. Now there's a combination -- steak and Petri Burgundy. That Petri Burgundy
         is
         a perfect mealtime wine. It's a rich, red wine that's hearty and full of flavor --
         flavor that comes right from the heart of the grape. And don't think that Petri Burgundy
         is only good with steak -- it'll make a hamburger sandwich taste like a feast, too.
         Try
         Petri Burgundy with any meat or meat dish. It's just wonderful! And serve it proudly,
         too, because after all, the name Petri is the proudest name in the history of American
         wines.</div>

      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Good evening, Mr. Bartell.</div>

         </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> You're quite muffled up tonight, I see. Overcoat, scarf and
         gloves. Slip 'em off and come and join me by the fire.</div>
      <div><em class="announcer">ANNOUNCER</em> Thanks, doctor. Quite a nip in the air tonight.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Yes, there is indeed.</div>
      <div><em class="announcer">ANNOUNCER</em> Well, doctor, you told us last week that tonight's story
         centered around the activities of a brilliant and beautiful woman.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Yes, my boy. Her name was Irene Adler. But I never
         knew<em class="mention"> Holmes</em> to refer to her by any other name than
         "The Woman."</div>
      <div><em class="announcer">ANNOUNCER</em> She sounds mighty intriguing. How did you happen to meet up
         with her?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Well, I'll tell you the story from the beginning. One night --
         it was on the twentieth of March, Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Eight, to be exact --
         I
         was returning home from a visit to a patient, when my steps led me through Baker Street.
         Since my marriage, I hadn't seen much of <em class="mention">Sherlock Holmes</em>
         and--</div>
      <div><em class="announcer">ANNOUNCER</em> You couldn't resist stopping by Two-Twenty-One B, I'm sure,
         doctor.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Of course I couldn't. As I stood outside the well-remembered
         door, I looked up at the lighted windows and saw the tall, spare figure of my old
         friend
         pass twice in dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,
         eagerly, with his head sunk on his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me,
         who
         knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was
         hot
         on the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and a few moments later, found myself
         standing before him. <em class="stageDirect">FADES OUT</em></div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">FADES IN</em> Marriage suits you,<em class="mention">
            Watson</em>. You look in splendid shape.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Yes,<em class="mention"> Holmes</em>, I'm feeling very
         well, thanks.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> And in practice again, I see. You didn't tell me that you'd
         gone back into harness.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">SURPRISED</em> Oh? How do you know?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Elementary, my dear chap. If a gentleman walks into my rooms
         smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver on his right forefinger
         and
         a bulge on the left side of his hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope,
         I
         should be dull, indeed, if I didn't pronounce him to be an active member of the medical
         profession.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">CHUCKLES</em> Same as ever,<em class="mention">
            Holmes</em>. By the way, I'm, uh-- I'm not interrupting you, am I?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Yes, you are, old fellow, but it's a most welcome
         interruption.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> You're working on a new case?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> It looks like it. This letter arrived by the last post today.
         It's undated, and has neither signature nor address. Read it.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">MUMBLES</em> Let's have a look. <em class="stageDirect">READS</em>
         "There will call upon you tonight, at a quarter to eight o'clock, a gentleman who
         desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services
         to
         one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted.
         This account of you we have from all quarters received." <em class="stageDirect">TO
            HIMSELF</em> Hm! <em class="stageDirect">READS</em> "Be in your chamber,
         then, at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask."
         <em class="stageDirect">TO HOLMES</em> Great Scott, it all sounds very mysterious.
         What do you imagine it means?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Look carefully at the note,<em class="mention">
            Watson</em>. What do you deduce from it?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Oh, let's see. Well, the man who wrote it was presumably
         well-to-do. Such paper couldn't be bought for under half a crown a packet. And it's
         peculiarly strong and stiff.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Peculiar -- that's the very word. It's not an English paper at
         all. Hold it up to the light. You notice anything?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Yes. There's a large "E" with a small "g"--</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">AGREES</em> Mm hm.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> --and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of
         the paper.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> What does that suggest to you?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> The name of the maker, no doubt; or perhaps his monogram.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Not at all, my dear fellow. The "G" with the small "t" stands
         for "Gesellschaft," which is the German for "Company."</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> And the "E - g"? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> That stands for Egria. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Egria?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> It's in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from
         Carlsbad. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> So the paper was made in Bohemia. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Undoubtedly. And the man who wrote the note is a German.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> How do you know that?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Observe the curious construction of the sentence, "This
         account of you we have from all quarters received." A Frenchman or a Russian could
         not
         have written that. It's the German who is so discourteous to his verbs.</div>

      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> There's your client now. I'd better go,<em class="mention">

      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> No, no, no, no -- unless you have to. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Well, I could stay; I thought perhaps that--</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Then, my dear chap, stay. by all means. I'm lost without my
         Boswell, and this promises to be interesting. I told Mrs. Hudson to let the masked

      <div>
         <em class="sound"> KING WALKS TO CHAIR AND SITS BEHIND--</em>
         </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> This is my friend and colleague, <em class="mention">Dr.
            Watson</em>. You may say anything before him that you can say to me. Whom have
         I the honor to address?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> You may address me as, er, Count Von Kramm.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> How do you do, sir?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> You must excuse this mask that I wear. The august person who
         employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the
         title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> I was well aware of that fact, sir. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> You see, <em class="mention">Mr. Holmes</em>, the matter
         I am about to discuss implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of
         Bohemia.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> That had not escaped me either, sir. In fact, if you will
         state your case, I shall be better able to advise you -- your Majesty.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">ASTONISHED</em> How--? How did you--?
         <em class="stageDirect">DECISIVELY</em> Yes. Yes, I am the King. Why should I attempt
         to conceal it?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Why, indeed?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> I shall remove the mask. <em class="stageDirect">BEAT</em> There.
         <em class="mention">Mr. Holmes</em>, I have traveled incognito from Prague
         for the express purpose of consulting you.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Then, pray consult. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Briefly, the facts are these. Some five years ago, during a
         visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene
         Adler.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Irene Adler? We know of her, your Majesty.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Look her up in the index for me, will you,<em class="mention"> Watson</em>? It's right beside you on the desk there.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> I imagined that her name would not be unfamiliar to you. </div>
      <div>
         <em class="sound"> SHUFFLE OF PAPERS ... IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--</em>
         </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Here we are, here we are. <em class="stageDirect">READS</em> "A.
         Abrahams, Actongreen <em class="stageDirect">Hatchet Murders</em>, Adler--" Adler.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Splendid. Hand me the file, old chap. Thank you. Mm hm!
         <em class="stageDirect">READS AND MUSES</em> "Irene Adler. Born in New Jersey in the
         United States of America in Eighteen Fifty-Eight. Contralto." Mm hm. "Prima donna,
         Imperial Opera of Warsaw." Oh. "Retired from operatic stage. Living in London." Quite
         so. And here's a recent notation -- uh huh. <em class="stageDirect">TO KING</em> Your
         Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some
         compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">AMAZED</em> Precisely so. But how could--?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Was there a secret marriage?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> None.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> No legal papers or certificates?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Er, no.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Then I fail to follow, your Majesty. If this young lady should
         produce her letters for blackmailing purposes, how is she to prove their
         authenticity?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> There is the handwriting.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> That could be a forgery, your Majesty.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> But it was private note-paper.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Stolen.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> My own seal.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Imitated.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> My photograph.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Bought.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> But - we were both in the photograph.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Oh, dear me. Yes, that's very bad. Your Majesty has indeed
         committed an indiscretion.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Did you inscribe this photograph, your Majesty?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Yes, <em class="mention">Dr. Watson</em>, I am afraid I
         did. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">MUMBLES</em> Good gracious me.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em>
         <em class="mention">Mr. Holmes</em>, it must be recovered. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Perhaps if you were to pay enough, the photograph might be
         bought. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> She refuses to sell. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Stolen, then.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked
         her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she traveled. Twice she has been waylaid.
         There has been no result.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Oh, dear, it's quite a pretty little problem. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> It is a deadly serious one to me. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Your Majesty, what does Miss Adler intend to do with the
         photograph? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> To ruin me. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> How, sir?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Well, I am about to be married to the second daughter of the
         King of Scandinavia. She is the [very] soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to
         my
         conduct would bring the matter to an end.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> And Irene Adler threatens to send the photograph to your
         fiancée, I suppose? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Yes, and she will do it. Rather than let me marry another woman,
         there are no lengths to which she would not go. None.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Are you sure that she hasn't already sent it, your
         Majesty?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> I am sure.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> And why?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> She said she would send it on the day my betrothal is publicly
         announced. That day will be next Monday.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Splendid! Then we still have three days. Your Majesty will, of
         course, stay in London for the present?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Yes, certainly. You will find me at the Langham Hotel,
         registered as Count Von Kramm.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Just two questions before you leave. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> What are they? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Is the photograph large or small? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Quite large. And it was in a heavy frame.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> I see. And what is Irene Adler's London address, please?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em> Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Thank you, your Majesty. Good night, and I trust that we shall
         soon have some good news for you.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">KING</em>

         morning. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> And then?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Then, my dear fellow, we will see what we can find out about
         Miss Irene Adler, late of the Warsaw Imperial Opera Company and at present residing
         at

      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Well,<em class="mention"> Holmes</em>, I guess the

      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> No. A bijou residence that represents the essence of dignified
         suburbia, but tells us very little about the owner. I think a visit to the local public
         house might prove more instructive. Come on, old chap. I see the door of the Coach

      <div><em class="speaker">BARTENDER</em> Well, it's the first I've heard of it -- but it might be

      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">COCKNEY</em> No, not yet. We thought we'd find out something about

         <em class="stageDirect">CHUCKLES</em> She ain't no old girl, matey. She's the prettiest

      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em>
         <em class="stageDirect">COCKNEY</em> You know her, governor? </div>

      <div><em class="speaker">BARTENDER</em> No. No, no. She lives quiet, like. Goes out singing at
         concerts once in a while. Rest of the time, it's money for gin. She goes out for a
         drive
         in the park every day at five and comes back to dinner at six-thirty. Rest of the

      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Yes, Mr. Bartell, we did, but the other carriages were there

         and there, in their separate conveyances. A moment later,<em class="mention">

      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> You're going to try and enter, then? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> I must, my dear fellow. I'm sure the photograph is there. Miss

         six-thirty. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> And what then?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> You must leave that to me. I've already made my arrangements.
         There is only one point on which I must insist -- you must not interfere, come what
         may.
         You understand?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> I'm to remain neutral?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Yes. There will be some small unpleasantness. Don't join in.
         It will end in my being conveyed into the house. As soon as I am able to, I shall
         open
         one of the windows. You are to watch from outside. When I raise my hand, you will
         throw
         an object -- that I shall give you -- through the window and, at the same time, cry
         "Fire!" You follow me?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Entirely. But what am I to throw? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Oh, it's nothing very formidable. Here it is. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Huh. Looks like a great big cigar. What is it?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> An ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at
         either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to throwing it through
         the
         window. When you raise the cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
         You may then walk to the end of the street, and I'll rejoin you in ten minutes. I
         hope
         I've made myself clear.</div>

      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> No, but I know where it is. She showed me, as I told you she
         would. </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Well, I'm still in the dark.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> There's no mystery, old chap. When my accomplices started the
         row in the street, I had a little moist red paint in my hand. My good friend Alfie
         pretended to strike me; I clapped my hand to my head and fell down. It's an old
         trick.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Yes, I understand that, but how did my throwing the rocket
         help you?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> It was all-important, my dear fellow. When a woman thinks her
         house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush for the thing that she values most.
         A
         married woman grabs her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. In this
         case,
         of course, it was the photograph.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Where was it?</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> In a recess in the living room, just above the right-hand
         bell-pull. I caught a glimpse of it as she drew it out. When I made it known that
         the
         fire was a false alarm, she replaced the photograph. As soon as I was able to, I advised
         her that I was feeling well enough to leave.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> You didn't take the photograph, then.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> No, I felt that over-precipitance at this stage might ruin
         everything.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> What do we do now? </div>
      <div><em class="speaker">HOLMES</em> Drive to the Langham Hotel and inform his Majesty of what has
         happened. Then return with him here. And after that, my dear chap, the case will be
         ended!</div>

      <div><em class="announcer">ANNOUNCER</em> Petri California Port is some wine! Boy, that Petri family
         really knows how to make good wine, all right. And no wonder. Look at all the experience
         they've had. Ever since they started the Petri business, way back in the eighteen
         hundreds, the Petri family has handed down from father to son -- from father to son
         --
         the art of selecting perfect, sun-ripened California grapes and making them into clear,
         fragrant, delicious wine. Those letters -- P-E-T-R-I -- on the label of every bottle
         of
         Petri wine are the personal assurance of the Petri family that every drop of wine
         in
         that bottle is good wine. It's got to be! Because Petri took time to bring you good
         wine. <em class="stageDirect">TO WATSON</em> Well, <em class="mention">Dr.
            Watson</em>, that was a great story you told us tonight.</div>
      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> I thought you'd like it, Mr. Bartell. That's why I plan to
         tell you a sequel to it next week.</div>

      <div><em class="speaker">WATSON</em> Oh, I think you'll find it proves to be, Mr. Bartell. It's a
         story that takes place twenty years after tonight's adventure. Once again, the principal
         part is played by a woman. Only in this case, it isn't Irene Adler. It's her daughter.
         <em class="stageDirect">BEAT</em> Oh, and, uh, now, Mr. Bartell, before I go I want to
         remind our listeners that they owe a real debt of gratitude to the Selective Service
         Boards in their communities. At this moment, the Selective Service Boards are working
         harder than ever, making sure that every returning veteran knows his rights and
         privileges. And the Boards are helping him take full advantage of those rights and
         privileges. They're helping our veterans get jobs. Our Selective Service Boards deserve
         our sincere thanks and they deserve our cooperation. They have done -- and they are
         doing -- a splendid job.</div>
