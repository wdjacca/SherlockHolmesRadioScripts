        <h3>Editorial Methodology</h3>
        <h4> Corpus Preparation </h4>
        <p>The radio scripts were sourced from the Generic Radio Workshop, where there were
            downloadable plain text (.txt) files that includes the body contents of the scripts. For
            the purpose of this research, metadata that was excluded from the plain text files at
            the top of the webpage display were also included into the files. There was a regular
            pattern of "series", "show", "date", and "cast", which led to the decision of strictly
            limiting the Relax NG schema code in this specific order. There were some discrepancies
            within the files, most notably being with "Murder in Casbah".</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>There were some major differences in the structure of the files in the radio script
                corpus, that being of: <ul class="innercontent">
                    <li class="innercontent">some scripts included a sound effect and special
                        effects list</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">some scripts have notes that indicate the author or
                        special notes</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">the order of the elements in the metadata columns would
                        be different depending on whether there was a sound effect and special
                        effect list, and notes</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">while most scripts have the regular pattern of
                        [SOUND/MUSIC:] to indicate the start of a sound effect or musical tune, some
                        have [SOUND FX] or [music]</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">there were minor typos such as ; and FC</li>
                    <li class="innercontent"> ome lines do not have a speaker attached, most likely
                        being part of a larger paragraph of speech that was broken into separate
                        lines in the script</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The content in the files in the corpus had to be regularized so that queries could be
            performed easily on them in the future, taking into consideration that any changes would
            not affect the contextual or structural analysis of the project.</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>The following changes to the corpus were made: <ul class="innercontent">
                    <li class="innercontent">a <code>&lt;lineGrp&gt;</code> element was added to
                        wrap around the spilt lines</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">a <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> element was added to wrap
                        around the lines in <code>&lt;lineGrp&gt;</code> to preserve the original
                        structure of the script</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">all lines were wrapped in <code>&lt;ln&gt;</code> for
                        consistency</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">all metadata elements were formatted to be in the same
                        order, regardless of the order it was in the original text</li>
                    <li class="innercontent">SOUND/MUSIC tags from the original text were removed
                        since <code>&lt;sound&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;music&gt;</code> served the
                        same purpose.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Radio Script V.S. Arthur Conan Doyle </h4>
        <p> The first step of analysis for the corpus was to mark the changes to the story from
            Arthur Conan Doyle's publication for the radio scripts. Text from Arthur Conan Doyle's
            original publication was sourced from Project Gutenberg, which allowed me to copy the
            text needed for the specific chapters into an XML file. For the initial stage of the
            analysis portion, I focused on the story "A Scandal in Bohemia", where there was a radio
            recording, the radio script, and original publication available online for comparison
            purposes. XSLT was used to plant <code> &lt;xml:id&gt;</code>s in the Arthur Conan Doyle
            texts.</p>
        <pre><code class="block">&lt;xsl:template match="p"&gt;
        &lt;p xml:id="{ancestor::xml/@xml:id}-p{count(preceding::p) + 1}"&gt;
            &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>These <code> &lt;xml:id&gt;</code> tags were used to stitch together the <code>
                &lt;ln&gt;</code> elements in the radio script to show the correlation between the
            two files. The XSLT allowed automatic tagging for the Arthur Conan Doyle texts, which
            then gave a pointer for me to use to manually tag segments of specifc paragraphs from
            the text</p>
        <p> Manual tagging was used for the segmented portions of the story where the changes
            between the two source files were not similar enough to be stitched together by the
            original paragraphs. </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li> In the Arthur Conan Doyle text, the <code>&lt;xml:id&gt;</code>'s are structured as
                followed: </li>
            <pre><code class="block">
            &lt;p xml:id="SIB-p4"&gt;His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
                to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an
                armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a
                gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his
                singular introspective fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            <li> With manual tagging, the <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code> tags are structured as followed: </li>
            <pre><code class="block">
                &lt;p xml:id="SIB-p7"&gt;“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
                fancy, Watson. 
                &lt;seg xml:id="SIB-p7-s1"&gt;And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you
                intended to go into harness.”&lt;/seg&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            <li> After the <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code> tags are put in place, I then stitch the radio
                script <code>&lt;ln&gt;</code> tags together manually after comparing the texts
                side-by-side, by using the <code>@pull</code> attribute, as followed:</li>
            <pre><code class="block">
                &lt;ln pull="#SIB-p7-s1"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;HOLMES&lt;/speaker&gt; And in practice again, I see. You didn't tell me that you'd gone back into harness.&lt;/ln&gt;</code></pre>
            <li> For some <code>&lt;ln&gt;</code> elements, it matches to several
                    <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code> elements. The multiple <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>
                elements are separated by white spaces in the following structure: </li>
            <pre><code class="block"> 
                &lt;ln pull="#SIB-p44-s1 #SIB-p44-s2 #SIB-p46-s1"&gt;
                &lt;speaker&gt;HOLMES&lt;/speaker&gt;
                This is my friend and colleague, &lt;mention ref="watson"&gt;Dr.Watson&lt;/mention&gt;. You may say anything before him that you can say to me. Whom have I the honor to address?&lt;/ln&gt;</code></pre>
            <li> Additional attributes are added to the <code>&lt;ln&gt;</code> tags to signify the
                nature of the relationship between the two text files. <ul class="innercontent">
                    <li><code>@change</code> is used to show the nature of the change by using the
                        values "wording", "interpel", and "sig". </li>
                    <pre><code class="block">
                &lt;ln pull="#SIB-p55" change="wording"&gt;
                    &lt;speaker&gt;HOLMES&lt;/speaker&gt; 
                    That had not escaped me either, sir. In fact, if you will state your case, I shall be better able to advise you -- your Majesty.&lt;/ln&gt;</code></pre>
                    <li>
                        <code>@type</code> is used to show unmatched lines that were significant to
                        the radio script but do not match up to any part of Arthur Conan Doyle's
                        publication, by using the value "unmatched". </li>
                    <pre><code class="block">
                &lt;ln type="unmatched" change="interpel sig"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;WATSON&lt;/speaker&gt; How do you do, sir?&lt;/ln&gt;</code></pre>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
