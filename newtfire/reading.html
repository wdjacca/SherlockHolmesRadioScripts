            <div><span class="nonstory">ANNOUNCER</span> The Petri family -- the family that took time to bring you
               good wine -- invites you to listen to <span class="mention">Dr. Watson</span> tell us
               another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective,
               <span class="mention">Sherlock Holmes</span>. And you know something? I had an
               adventure tonight I wish you could have shared with me. I had a steak about, oh, an
               inch
               and a half thick, tender and juicy, and with it I had a glass of Petri California
               Burgundy. Now there's a combination -- steak and Petri Burgundy. That Petri Burgundy
               is
               a perfect mealtime wine. It's a rich, red wine that's hearty and full of flavor --
               flavor that comes right from the heart of the grape. And don't think that Petri Burgundy
               is only good with steak -- it'll make a hamburger sandwich taste like a feast, too.
               Try
               Petri Burgundy with any meat or meat dish. It's just wonderful! And serve it proudly,
               too, because after all, the name Petri is the proudest name in the history of American
               wines.</div>

            <div><span class="nonstory">ANNOUNCER</span> Well, doctor, you told us last week that tonight's story
               centered around the activities of a brilliant and beautiful woman.</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p1-s1"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> Yes, my boy. Her name was Irene Adler. But I never
               knew<span class="mention"> Holmes</span> to refer to her by any other name than
               "The Woman."</div>
            <div><span class="nonstory">ANNOUNCER</span> She sounds mighty intriguing. How did you happen to meet up
               with her?</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p3-s1 #SIB-p2-s1"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> Well, I'll tell you the story from the beginning. One night --
               it was on the twentieth of March, Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Eight, to be exact --
               I
               was returning home from a visit to a patient, when my steps led me through Baker Street.
               Since my marriage, I hadn't seen much of <span class="mention">Sherlock Holmes</span>
               and--</div>
            <div><span class="nonstory">ANNOUNCER</span> You couldn't resist stopping by Two-Twenty-One B, I'm sure,
               doctor.</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p3-s2 #SIB-p3-s2"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> Of course I couldn't. As I stood outside the well-remembered
               door, I looked up at the lighted windows and saw the tall, spare figure of my old
               friend
               pass twice in dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,
               eagerly, with his head sunk on his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me,
               who
               knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was
               hot
               on the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and a few moments later, found myself
               standing before him. <span class="stageDirect toggle">FADES OUT</span></div>

            <div data-pull="#SIB-p12-s1"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> Elementary, my dear chap. If a gentleman walks into my rooms
               smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver on his right forefinger
               and
               a bulge on the left side of his hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope,
               I
               should be dull, indeed, if I didn't pronounce him to be an active member of the medical
               profession.</div>

               interruption.</div>

            <div data-pull="#SIB-p21"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> It looks like it. This letter arrived by the last post today.
               It's undated, and has neither signature nor address. Read it.</div>

               "There will call upon you tonight, at a quarter to eight o'clock, a gentleman who
               desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services
               to
               one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted.
               This account of you we have from all quarters received." <span class="stageDirect toggle">TO

               then, at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask."
               <span class="stageDirect toggle">TO HOLMES</span> Great Scott, it all sounds very mysterious.
               What do you imagine it means?</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p24-s1"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> Look carefully at the note,<span class="mention">
                  Watson</span>. What do you deduce from it?</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p26"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> Oh, let's see. Well, the man who wrote it was presumably
               well-to-do. Such paper couldn't be bought for under half a crown a packet. And it's
               peculiarly strong and stiff.</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p27"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> Peculiar -- that's the very word. It's not an English paper at
               all. Hold it up to the light. You notice anything?</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p28"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> Yes. There's a large "E" with a small "g"--</div>

            <div data-pull="#SIB-p28"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> --and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of
               the paper.</div>
            <div><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> What does that suggest to you?</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p30"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> The name of the maker, no doubt; or perhaps his monogram.</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p31-s1"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> Not at all, my dear fellow. The "G" with the small "t" stands
               for "Gesellschaft," which is the German for "Company."</div>
            <div><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> And the "E - g"? </div>
            <div><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> That stands for Egria. </div>
            <div><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> Egria?</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p31-s2"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> It's in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from
               Carlsbad. </div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p32"><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> So the paper was made in Bohemia. </div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p33-s1"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> Undoubtedly. And the man who wrote the note is a German.</div>
            <div><span class="speaker">WATSON</span> How do you know that?</div>
            <div data-pull="#SIB-p33-s1 #SIB-p33-s2 #SIB-p33-s3" class="wording"><span class="speaker">HOLMES</span> Observe the curious construction of the sentence, "This
               account of you we have from all quarters received." A Frenchman or a Russian could
               not
               have written that. It's the German who is so discourteous to his verbs.</div>

               that chicken with Petri California Sauterne. Believe me, Petri Sauterne is just about
               the last word in white wines. It's beautifully golden in color, it's delicate and
               intriguing in flavor and it's just-- Well, you taste it and see for yourself. If you
               want a delicious white wine, you certainly want Petri Sauterne. <span class="stageDirect toggle">TO

               church inside the twenty minutes?</div>

               to guard the outside. I must have waited for ten minutes or more before Mr. Geoffrey
               Norton and Miss Adler came out, spoke a few words to each other and then left -- then
               and there, in their separate conveyances. A moment later,<span class="mention">
                  Holmes</span> -- still dressed as a stable hand -- came striding out of the

               the art of selecting perfect, sun-ripened California grapes and making them into clear,
