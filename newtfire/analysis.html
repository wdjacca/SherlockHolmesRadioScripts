        <p> Sherlock Holmes is often referred to a great detective by his audience, who read his many tales of crimes and mysteries he solved. However, was Sherlock Holmes always seen as the wonderful, noble man that he is now? Sherlock Holmes was often referred to as Holmes, Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes, and Mr. Holmes. The different ways that the society hails him follows the theory of interpellation, the name used reflects the subject's view of themselves within the context of the society. </p>
        <p> Between the script and the original Conan-Doyle script, there were several instance of changes in the way that Holmes and the characters are hailed. For example, in "A Scandal in Bohemia", Conan-Doyle's version of Sherlock Holmes did not refer to the King as "sir" or "your Majesty" like Watson did, which may indicate that he does not view the King as any different than his other customers. However, the radio script's version showed Sherlock Holmes addressing the King strictly as "sir", which displays a level of authority of the King over Sherlock Holmes. In Conan-Doyle's original script, the topic of payment for Holmes's services to the King was explicitly mentioned. </p> <pre><blockquote>“Then, as to money?”

“You have carte blanche.”

“Absolutely?”

“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.”

“And for present expenses?”

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said."</blockquote></pre>
<p>This direct request for payment was not seen in the radio script; there was simply no mention by Sherlock Holmes of a form of payment from the King for his services, the King had offered his ring but Holmes declined it. It could be understood that the depiction of Holmes in the radio script implies that he views his service for the King as an honor, while Conan-Doyle's version of Holmes simply sees the current task as any other task he was given, regardless of the high status of the client. </p></section>
