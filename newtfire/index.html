       <h3> Welcome to Sherlock Holmes on the Radio Airwaves: A Digital Remediation and Analysis</h3>
       <p> This website serves as the digital project portion to my Schreyer's Honors Thesis.</p>

       <p class="head"> Thesis Proposal : Overview </p>
       <p>The thesis investigates the radio scripts on “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes” from the 1930s to 1950s. It builds on an XML-based project in which the analysis and outcome will be documented on a website. The project will incorporate text analysis approaches such as natural language processing and will use XML-based languages such as SVGs (scalable vector graphics)  for the presentation of data. The project would include an interactive representation of the radio scripts, with both visual and audio archives. The first research question I want to investigate is: how were the roles of the British society reflected in the way Holmes was called or hailed, by his peers, colleagues, government officials, the general public? This part of my analysis will build on the Marxist theories of ideology and interpellation by Louis Althusser, to investigate roles in the British society that are not common in the US and the language used in reflecting the social rank and authority of such roles. The second part of the analysis would investigate the question of how the production of the Sherlock Holmes series has evolved, starting from Arthur Conan Doyle’s writings, starting from the 1890s  to more recent productions up until the early 21st century. The last research question I would like to investigate is: what was the language used to describe crime and the society at the time of the radio scripts?</p>
       <p class="head"> Final Product </p>
       <p> The outcome of the analysis will be a website that documents the analysis process of the projects and displays a remediation of the radio scripts. My web edition of the radio scripts will highlight unfamiliar words and terms of British English, especially to US readers and listeners, by including an interactive glossary that displays on hover. The website would also include infographics that reflect the relationships of Holmes and the people around him through the language used to address him. The project would include a timeline to contextualize the early radio play adaptations of the Sherlock Holmes series in relation to Conan Doyle’s writings and the context in which the radio plays were aired over the radio during 1930s to 1950s, specifically during the years of WWII. Linguistic patterns that reflect changing social ranks in the British society during the WWII era would be documented on the website. The site and the thesis will apply natural language processing to compare and contrast the language of the British society from Conan Doyle’s writings to the radio scripts, representing the changes in British society from the 1890s to 1950s.</p>
       <p class="head"> Thesis Timeline </p>
       <p> The timeline of the completion of the thesis is shown on the right, where the thesis proposal above was submitted for Schreyer and faculty approval in SP2021. The project is currently in the documentation / stitch work phase, with plans to complete the stitch work for the whole corpus over Dec 2021 and Jan 2022.</p></div><img src="images/timeline.png" alt="Thesis Timeline"></div>
