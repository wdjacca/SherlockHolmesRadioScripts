        <chapter num="1">
            <p xml:id="SB-p1">I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,” said Holmes, as we sat
                down together to our breakfast one morning.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p2">“Go! Where to?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p3">“To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p4">I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not
                already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of
                conversation through the length and breadth of England. For a whole day my companion
                had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted,
                charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely
                deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions of every paper had been sent
                up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet,
                silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding.
                There was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of
                analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex
                Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced
                his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only what I had both
                expected and hoped for.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p5">“I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in the
                way,” said I.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p6">“My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by coming.
                And I think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about the case
                which promise to make it an absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to
                catch our train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon our
                journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent
                field-glass.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p7">And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the
                corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for Exeter, while Sherlock
                Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped
                rapidly into the bundle of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had
                left Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under the seat, and
                offered me his cigar-case.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p8">“We are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing at
                his watch. “Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p9">“I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said I.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p10">“Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards
                apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that you have looked into this
                matter of the murder of John Straker and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p11">“I have seen what the Telegraph and the Chronicle have to say.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p12">“It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be
                used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh evidence. The
                tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and of such personal importance to so many
                people, that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and
                hypothesis. The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact—of absolute undeniable
                fact—from the embellishments of theorists and reporters. Then, having established
                ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn
                and what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns. On Tuesday
                evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross, the owner of the horse, and
                from Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the case, inviting my
                co-operation.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p13">“Tuesday evening!” I exclaimed. “And this is Thursday morning. Why
                didn’t you go down yesterday?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p14">“Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson—which is, I am afraid, a
                more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew me through your
                memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it possible that the most remarkable
                horse in England could long remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a
                place as the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to hear that
                he had been found, and that his abductor was the murderer of John Straker. When,
                however, another morning had come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young
                Fitzroy Simpson nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take
                action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been wasted.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p15">“You have formed a theory, then?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p16">“At least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I
                shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to
                another person, and I can hardly expect your co-operation if I do not show you the
                position from which we start.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p17">I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while Holmes,
                leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking off the points upon the
                palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the events which had led to our
                journey.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p18">“Silver Blaze,” said he, “is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as
                brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth year, and has
                brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner.
                Up to the time of the catastrophe he was the first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the
                betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a prime favourite
                with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those
                odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that
                there were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver Blaze
                from being there at the fall of the flag next Tuesday.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p19">“The fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the
                Colonel’s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken to guard the
                favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired jockey who rode in Colonel Ross’s
                colours before he became too heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel
                for five years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown himself to
                be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three lads; for the establishment
                was a small one, containing only four horses in all. One of these lads sat up each
                night in the stable, while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent
                characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small villa about two
                hundred yards from the stables. He has no children, keeps one maid-servant, and is
                comfortably off. The country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the
                north there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a Tavistock
                contractor for the use of invalids and others who may wish to enjoy the pure
                Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two miles to the west, while across the moor,
                also about two miles distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton,
                which belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In every other
                direction the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only by a few roaming
                gypsies. Such was the general situation last Monday night when the catastrophe
                occurred.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p20">“On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as usual,
                and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the lads walked up to the
                trainer’s house, where they had supper in the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter,
                remained on guard. At a few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down
                to the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. She took no
                liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on
                duty should drink nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very
                dark and the path ran across the open moor.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p21">“Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man
                appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he stepped into the
                circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person of
                gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore
                gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed,
                however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness of his manner. His
                age, she thought, would be rather over thirty than under it.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p22">“‘Can you tell me where I am?’ he asked. ‘I had almost made up my
                mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.’</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p23">“‘You are close to the King’s Pyland training-stables,’ said she.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p24">“‘Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!’ he cried. ‘I understand that a
                stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is his supper which you are
                carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of
                a new dress, would you?’ He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his
                waistcoat pocket. ‘See that the boy has this to-night, and you shall have the
                prettiest frock that money can buy.’</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p25">“She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran past
                him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand the meals. It was already
                opened, and Hunter was seated at the small table inside. She had begun to tell him
                of what had happened, when the stranger came up again.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p26">“‘Good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘I wanted to
                have a word with you.’ The girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner of
                the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p27">“‘What business have you here?’ asked the lad.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p28">“‘It’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said the
                other. ‘You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze and Bayard. Let me have
                the straight tip and you won’t be a loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard
                could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put
                their money on him?’</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p29">“‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll show
                you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and rushed across the stable
                to unloose the dog. The girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she looked back
                and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however,
                when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he ran all round the
                buildings he failed to find any trace of him.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p30">“One moment,” I asked. “Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with the
                dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p31">“Excellent, Watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “The
                importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dartmoor
                yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy locked the door before he left it. The
                window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to get through.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p32">“Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a
                message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker was excited at
                hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realized its true
                significance. It left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one
                in the morning, found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said that
                he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses, and that he intended
                to walk down to the stables to see that all was well. She begged him to remain at
                home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her
                entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p33">“Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her husband
                had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off for
                the stables. The door was open; inside, huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was
                sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were
                no signs of his trainer.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p34">“The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the
                harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during the night, for they
                are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously under the influence of some powerful
                drug, and as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the
                two lads and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still had hopes
                that the trainer had for some reason taken out the horse for early exercise, but on
                ascending the knoll near the house, from which all the neighbouring moors were
                visible, they not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they
                perceived something which warned them that they were in the presence of a
                tragedy.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p35">“About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s overcoat
                was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped
                depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body of the
                unfortunate trainer. His head had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy
                weapon, and he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut,
                inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear, however, that
                Straker had defended himself vigorously against his assailants, for in his right
                hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in
                his left he clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the maid as
                having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the
                stables.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p36">“Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to
                the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that the same stranger had,
                while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so deprived the
                stables of their watchman.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p37">“As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which
                lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been there at the time of the
                struggle. But from that morning he has disappeared, and although a large reward has
                been offered, and all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of
                him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his supper left by the
                stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium, while the people at
                the house partook of the same dish on the same night without any ill effect.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p38">“Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise, and
                stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what the police have done in
                the matter.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p39">“Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an
                extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to
                great heights in his profession. On his arrival he promptly found and arrested the
                man upon whom suspicion naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding
                him, for he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His name, it
                appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent birth and education, who had
                squandered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now by doing a little quiet and
                genteel book-making in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his
                betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been
                registered by him against the favourite.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p40">“On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come down
                to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about the King’s Pyland horses,
                and also about Desborough, the second favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown
                at the Mapleton stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described
                upon the evening before, but declared that he had no sinister designs, and had
                simply wished to obtain first-hand information. When confronted with his cravat, he
                turned very pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of
                the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the
                night before, and his stick, which was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just
                such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to
                which the trainer had succumbed.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p41">“On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the
                state of Straker’s knife would show that one at least of his assailants must bear
                his mark upon him. There you have it all in a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give
                me any light I shall be infinitely obliged to you.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p42">I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which
                Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though most of the facts
                were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently appreciated their relative importance,
                nor their connection to each other.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p43">“Is it not possible,” I suggested, “that the incised wound upon
                Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which
                follow any brain injury?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p44">“It is more than possible; it is probable,” said Holmes. “In that
                case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p45">“And yet,” said I, “even now I fail to understand what the theory of
                the police can be.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p46">“I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections
                to it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I take it, that this Fitzroy
                Simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in some way obtained a duplicate key,
                opened the stable door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of
                kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have put this
                on. Then, having left the door open behind him, he was leading the horse away over
                the moor, when he was either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally
                ensued. Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick without receiving
                any injury from the small knife which Straker used in self-defence, and then the
                thief either led the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have
                bolted during the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the case
                as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all other explanations are
                more improbable still. However, I shall very quickly test the matter when I am once
                upon the spot, and until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than
                our present position.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p47">It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock, which
                lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor. Two
                gentlemen were awaiting us in the station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like
                hair and beard and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small, alert
                person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little
                side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was Colonel Ross, the well-known
                sportsman; the other, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in
                the English detective service.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p48">“I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,” said the
                Colonel. “The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I
                wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and in recovering
                my horse.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p49">“Have there been any fresh developments?” asked Holmes.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p50">“I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said the
                Inspector. “We have an open carriage outside, and as you would no doubt like to see
                the place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we drive.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p51">A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and were
                rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector Gregory was full of his
                case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while Holmes threw in an occasional
                question or interjection. Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat
                tilted over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of the two
                detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost exactly what Holmes
                had foretold in the train.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p52">“The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,” he remarked,
                “and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same time I recognise that the
                evidence is purely circumstantial, and that some new development may upset it.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p53">“How about Straker’s knife?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p54">“We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his
                fall.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p55">“My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. If
                so, it would tell against this man Simpson.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p56">“Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The
                evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great interest in the
                disappearance of the favourite. He lies under suspicion of having poisoned the
                stable-boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick,
                and his cravat was found in the dead man’s hand. I really think we have enough to go
                before a jury.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p57">Holmes shook his head. “A clever counsel would tear it all to rags,”
                said he. “Why should he take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to injure it
                why could he not do it there? Has a duplicate key been found in his possession? What
                chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the
                district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own explanation as to
                the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable-boy?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p58">“He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his purse.
                But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not a stranger
                to the district. He has twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was
                probably brought from London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled
                away. The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the
                moor.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p59">“What does he say about the cravat?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p60">“He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost it.
                But a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his
                leading the horse from the stable.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p61">Holmes pricked up his ears.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p62">“We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on
                Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they
                were gone. Now, presuming that there was some understanding between Simpson and
                these gypsies, might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was
                overtaken, and may they not have him now?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p63">“It is certainly possible.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p64">“The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also examined
                every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p65">“There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p66">“Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. As
                Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the
                disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown, the trainer, is known to have had large
                bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however,
                examined the stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p67">“And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of the
                Mapleton stables?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p68">“Nothing at all.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p69">Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased. A
                few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with
                overhanging eaves which stood by the road. Some distance off, across a paddock, lay
                a long grey-tiled out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the moor,
                bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to the sky-line, broken only
                by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a cluster of houses away to the westward which
                marked the Mapleton stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who
                continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely
                absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I touched his arm that he roused
                himself with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p70">“Excuse me,” said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at him
                in some surprise. “I was day-dreaming.” There was a gleam in his eyes and a
                suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to his ways,
                that his hand was upon a clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p71">“Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime,
                Mr. Holmes?” said Gregory.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p72">“I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into one
                or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I presume?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p73">“Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p74">“He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p75">“I have always found him an excellent servant.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p76">“I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets
                at the time of his death, Inspector?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p77">“I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would care
                to see them.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p78">“I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat
                round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid a
                small heap of things before us. There was a box of vestas, two inches of tallow
                candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of
                long-cut Cavendish, a silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an
                aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife with a very
                delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss &amp;amp; Co., London.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p79">“This is a very singular knife,” said Holmes, lifting it up and
                examining it minutely. “I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it, that it is the one
                which was found in the dead man’s grasp. Watson, this knife is surely in your
                line?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p80">“It is what we call a cataract knife,” said I.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p81">“I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work.
                A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as
                it would not shut in his pocket.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p82">“The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his
                body,” said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the
                dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. It was a poor
                weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hands on at the moment.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p83">“Very possible. How about these papers?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p84">“Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them is a
                letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a milliner’s account for
                thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William
                Derbyshire. Mrs. Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s and
                that occasionally his letters were addressed here.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p85">“Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked Holmes,
                glancing down the account. “Twenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a single costume.
                However there appears to be nothing more to learn, and we may now go down to the
                scene of the crime.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p86">As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting in
                the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the Inspector’s sleeve. Her
                face was haggard and thin and eager, stamped with the print of a recent horror.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p87">“Have you got them? Have you found them?” she panted.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p88">“No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to help
                us, and we shall do all that is possible.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p89">“Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time ago,
                Mrs. Straker?” said Holmes.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p90">“No, sir; you are mistaken.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p91">“Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of
                dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p92">“I never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p93">“Ah, that quite settles it,” said Holmes. And with an apology he
                followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took us to the hollow
                in which the body had been found. At the brink of it was the furze-bush upon which
                the coat had been hung.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p94">“There was no wind that night, I understand,” said Holmes.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p95">“None; but very heavy rain.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p96">“In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush, but
                placed there.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p97">“Yes, it was laid across the bush.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p98">“You fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been
                trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since Monday night.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p99">“A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have all
                stood upon that.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p100">“Excellent.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p101">“In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of
                Fitzroy Simpson’s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p102">“My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!” Holmes took the bag, and,
                descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a more central position. Then
                stretching himself upon his face and leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a
                careful study of the trampled mud in front of him. “Hullo!” said he, suddenly.
                “What’s this?” It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with mud that it
                looked at first like a little chip of wood.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p103">“I cannot think how I came to overlook it,” said the Inspector, with
                an expression of annoyance.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p104">“It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was
                looking for it.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p105">“What! You expected to find it?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p106">“I thought it not unlikely.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p107">He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of each
                of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to the rim of the hollow,
                and crawled about among the ferns and bushes.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p108">“I am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the Inspector. “I
                have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p109">“Indeed!” said Holmes, rising. “I should not have the impertinence
                to do it again after what you say. But I should like to take a little walk over the
                moor before it grows dark, that I may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I
                shall put this horseshoe into my pocket for luck.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p110">Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my
                companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch. “I wish you
                would come back with me, Inspector,” said he. “There are several points on which I
                should like your advice, and especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public
                to remove our horse’s name from the entries for the Cup.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p111">“Certainly not,” cried Holmes, with decision. “I should let the name
                stand.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p112">The Colonel bowed. “I am very glad to have had your opinion, sir,”
                said he. “You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you have finished your walk,
                and we can drive together into Tavistock.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p113">He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked slowly
                across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of Mapleton, and
                the long, sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich,
                ruddy browns where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the
                glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who was sunk in the
                deepest thought.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p114">“It’s this way, Watson,” said he at last. “We may leave the question
                of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding out
                what has become of the horse. Now, supposing that he broke away during or after the
                tragedy, where could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature. If
                left to himself his instincts would have been either to return to King’s Pyland or
                go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild upon the moor? He would surely have been
                seen by now. And why should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when
                they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. They could
                not hope to sell such a horse. They would run a great risk and gain nothing by
                taking him. Surely that is clear.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p115">“Where is he, then?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p116">“I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or to
                Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let us take that
                as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the
                Inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and
                you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which must have been
                very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is correct, then the horse must have
                crossed that, and there is the point where we should look for his tracks.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p117">We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few more
                minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’ request I walked down the
                bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I
                heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was
                plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which he took from
                his pocket exactly fitted the impression.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p118">“See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one quality
                which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have happened, acted upon the
                supposition, and find ourselves justified. Let us proceed.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p119">We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile of
                dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on the tracks. Then we
                lost them for half a mile, but only to pick them up once more quite close to
                Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing with a look of
                triumph upon his face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p120">“The horse was alone before,” I cried.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p121">“Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p122">The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of King’s
                Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after it. His eyes were on the
                trail, but I happened to look a little to one side, and saw to my surprise the same
                tracks coming back again in the opposite direction.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p123">“One for you, Watson,” said Holmes, when I pointed it out. “You have
                saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on our own traces. Let us
                follow the return track.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p124">We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led up
                to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a groom ran out from
                them.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p125">“We don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p126">“I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger and
                thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see your master, Mr. Silas
                Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock to-morrow morning?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p127">“Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always
                the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions for himself. No,
                sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch your money.
                Afterwards, if you like.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p128">As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn from
                his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the gate with a
                hunting-crop swinging in his hand.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p129">“What’s this, Dawson!” he cried. “No gossiping! Go about your
                business! And you, what the devil do you want here?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p130">“Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the
                sweetest of voices.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p131">“I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no strangers here.
                Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p132">Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s ear.
                He started violently and flushed to the temples.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p133">“It’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p134">“Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over
                in your parlour?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p135">“Oh, come in if you wish to.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p136">Holmes smiled. “I shall not keep you more than a few minutes,
                Watson,” said he. “Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p137">It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys before
                Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such a change as had been
                brought about in Silas Brown in that short time. His face was ashy pale, beads of
                perspiration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged
                like a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too, and he
                cringed along at my companion’s side like a dog with its master.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p138">“Your instructions will be done. It shall all be done,” said he.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p139">“There must be no mistake,” said Holmes, looking round at him. The
                other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p140">“Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I
                change it first or not?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p141">Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. “No, don’t,”
                said he; “I shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, or—”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p142">“Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p143">“Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.” He
                turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the other held out to
                him, and we set off for King’s Pyland.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p144">“A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than Master
                Silas Brown I have seldom met with,” remarked Holmes as we trudged along
                together.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p145">“He has the horse, then?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p146">“He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly
                what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced that I was watching
                him. Of course you observed the peculiarly square toes in the impressions, and that
                his own boots exactly corresponded to them. Again, of course no subordinate would
                have dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according to his custom
                he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor. How he
                went out to it, and his astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which
                has given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power the only horse
                which could beat the one upon which he had put his money. Then I described how his
                first impulse had been to lead him back to King’s Pyland, and how the devil had
                shown him how he could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led it
                back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every detail he gave it up and
                thought only of saving his own skin.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p147">“But his stables had been searched?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p148">“Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p149">“But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since
                he has every interest in injuring it?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p150">“My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He knows
                that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p151">“Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to
                show much mercy in any case.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p152">“The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own
                methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the advantage of being
                unofficial. I don’t know whether you observed it, Watson, but the Colonel’s manner
                has been just a trifle cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement
                at his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p153">“Certainly not without your permission.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p154">“And of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the
                question of who killed John Straker.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p155">“And you will devote yourself to that?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p156">“On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p157">I was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. We had only been a few
                hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation which he had begun
                so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. Not a word more could I draw from
                him until we were back at the trainer’s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were
                awaiting us in the parlour.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p158">“My friend and I return to town by the night-express,” said Holmes.
                “We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful Dartmoor air.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p159">The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel’s lip curled in a
                sneer.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p160">“So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,” said
                he.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p161">Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “There are certainly grave
                difficulties in the way,” said he. “I have every hope, however, that your horse will
                start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. Might I
                ask for a photograph of Mr. John Straker?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p162">The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p163">“My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you to
                wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should like to put to the
                maid.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p164">“I must say that I am rather disappointed in our London consultant,”
                said Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the room. “I do not see that we are
                any further than when he came.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p165">“At least you have his assurance that your horse will run,” said
                I.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p166">“Yes, I have his assurance,” said the Colonel, with a shrug of his
                shoulders. “I should prefer to have the horse.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p167">I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he
                entered the room again.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p168">“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “I am quite ready for Tavistock.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p169">As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the door
                open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and
                touched the lad upon the sleeve.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p170">“You have a few sheep in the paddock,” he said. “Who attends to
                them?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p171">“I do, sir.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p172">“Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p173">“Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone lame,
                sir.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p174">I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled and
                rubbed his hands together.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p175">“A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,” said he, pinching my arm.
                “Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic among the sheep.
                Drive on, coachman!”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p176">Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor opinion
                which he had formed of my companion’s ability, but I saw by the Inspector’s face
                that his attention had been keenly aroused.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p177">“You consider that to be important?” he asked.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p178">“Exceedingly so.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p179">“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my
                attention?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p180">“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p181">“The dog did nothing in the night-time.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p182">“That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p183">Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for
                Winchester to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met us by appointment
                outside the station, and we drove in his drag to the course beyond the town. His
                face was grave, and his manner was cold in the extreme.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p184">“I have seen nothing of my horse,” said he.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p185">“I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?” asked
                Holmes.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p186">The Colonel was very angry. “I have been on the turf for twenty
                years, and never was asked such a question as that before,” said he. “A child would
                know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and his mottled off-foreleg.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p187">“How is the betting?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p188">“Well, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen to
                one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter, until you can hardly
                get three to one now.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p189">“Hum!” said Holmes. “Somebody knows something, that is clear.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p190">As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I glanced
                at the card to see the entries. It ran:—</p> Wessex Plate. 50 sovs each h ft with
            1000 sovs added for four and five year olds. Second, £300. Third, £200. New course (one
            mile and five furlongs). 1. Mr. Heath Newton’s The Negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket). 2.
            Colonel Wardlaw’s Pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket). 3. Lord Backwater’s
            Desborough (yellow cap and sleeves). 4. Colonel Ross’s Silver Blaze (black cap, red
            jacket). 5. Duke of Balmoral’s Iris (yellow and black stripes). <p xml:id="SB-p191">6.
                Lord Singleford’s Rasper (purple cap, black sleeves).</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p192">“We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,” said
                the Colonel. “Why, what is that? Silver Blaze favourite?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p193">“Five to four against Silver Blaze!” roared the ring. “Five to four
                against Silver Blaze! Five to fifteen against Desborough! Five to four on the
                field!”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p194">“There are the numbers up,” I cried. “They are all six there.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p195">“All six there? Then my horse is running,” cried the Colonel in
                great agitation. “But I don’t see him. My colours have not passed.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p196">“Only five have passed. This must be he.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p197">As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing
                enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the well-known black and red of
                the Colonel.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p198">“That’s not my horse,” cried the owner. “That beast has not a white
                hair upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr. Holmes?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p199">“Well, well, let us see how he gets on,” said my friend,
                imperturbably. For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass. “Capital! An
                excellent start!” he cried suddenly. “There they are, coming round the curve!”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p200">From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight. The
                six horses were so close together that a carpet could have covered them, but half
                way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable showed to the front. Before they reached
                us, however, Desborough’s bolt was shot, and the Colonel’s horse, coming away with a
                rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival, the Duke of Balmoral’s
                Iris making a bad third.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p201">“It’s my race, anyhow,” gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over
                his eyes. “I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it. Don’t you think
                that you have kept up your mystery long enough, Mr. Holmes?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p202">“Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go round
                and have a look at the horse together. Here he is,” he continued, as we made our way
                into the weighing enclosure, where only owners and their friends find admittance.
                “You have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find
                that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p203">“You take my breath away!”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p204">“I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of
                running him just as he was sent over.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p205">“My dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and
                well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand apologies for having
                doubted your ability. You have done me a great service by recovering my horse. You
                would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John
                Straker.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p206">“I have done so,” said Holmes quietly.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p207">The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. “You have got him!
                Where is he, then?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p208">“He is here.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p209">“Here! Where?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p210">“In my company at the present moment.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p211">The Colonel flushed angrily. “I quite recognise that I am under
                obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but I must regard what you have just said
                as either a very bad joke or an insult.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p212">Sherlock Holmes laughed. “I assure you that I have not associated
                you with the crime, Colonel,” said he. “The real murderer is standing immediately
                behind you.” He stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy neck of the
                thoroughbred.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p213">“The horse!” cried both the Colonel and myself.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p214">“Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was
                done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of
                your confidence. But there goes the bell, and as I stand to win a little on this
                next race, I shall defer a lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p215">We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as we
                whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel Ross
                as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion’s narrative of the events
                which had occurred at the Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the
                means by which he had unravelled them.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p216">“I confess,” said he, “that any theories which I had formed from the
                newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were indications there, had
                they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import. I went to
                Devonshire with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although,
                of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete. It was
                while I was in the carriage, just as we reached the trainer’s house, that the
                immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I
                was distrait, and remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in
                my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p217">“I confess,” said the Colonel, “that even now I cannot see how it
                helps us.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p218">“It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium is
                by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. Were
                it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would
                probably eat no more. A curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this
                taste. By no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have caused
                curry to be served in the trainer’s family that night, and it is surely too
                monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with powdered
                opium upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the
                flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case,
                and our attention centres upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could
                have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish
                was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill
                effects. Which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing
                them?</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p219">“Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of the
                silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others. The Simpson
                incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though some one
                had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two
                lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one whom the dog knew
                well.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p220">“I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker
                went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. For
                what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his own
                stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss to know why. There have been cases before now
                where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own
                horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by fraud. Sometimes it
                is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some surer and subtler means. What was it here?
                I hoped that the contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p221">“And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife which
                was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would choose
                for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told us, a form of knife which is used for the
                most delicate operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate
                operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of turf matters,
                Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a
                horse’s ham, and to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A
                horse so treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down to a
                strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p222">“Villain! Scoundrel!” cried the Colonel.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p223">“We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take the
                horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have certainly roused the
                soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife. It was absolutely
                necessary to do it in the open air.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p224">“I have been blind!” cried the Colonel. “Of course that was why he
                needed the candle, and struck the match.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p225">“Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate enough
                to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its motives. As a man of the
                world, Colonel, you know that men do not carry other people’s bills about in their
                pockets. We have most of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once
                concluded that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second
                establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a lady in the case, and
                one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as you are with your servants, one can hardly
                expect that they can buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I
                questioned Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied
                myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of the milliner’s address, and
                felt that by calling there with Straker’s photograph I could easily dispose of the
                mythical Derbyshire.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p226">“From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse to a
                hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his flight had dropped his
                cravat, and Straker had picked it up—with some idea, perhaps, that he might use it
                in securing the horse’s leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had
                struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare, and with the
                strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out,
                and the steel shoe had struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite
                of the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he
                fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make it clear?”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p227">“Wonderful!” cried the Colonel. “Wonderful! You might have been
                there!”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p228">“My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that so
                astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without a
                little practice. What could he practice on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked
                a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p229">“When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had
                recognised Straker as an excellent customer of the name of Derbyshire, who had a
                very dashing wife, with a strong partiality for expensive dresses. I have no doubt
                that this woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this
                miserable plot.”</p>
            <p xml:id="SB-p230">“You have explained all but one thing,” cried the Colonel. “Where
                was the horse?”</p> “Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We
            must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham Junction, if I am not
            mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a
            cigar in our rooms, Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which might
            interest you.”</chapter>
