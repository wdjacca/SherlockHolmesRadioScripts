        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> This episode from the life of <mention ref="holmes"
                >Sherlock Holmes</mention> will be transmitted to our men and women overseas by
            short wave and through the worldwide facilities of the Armed Forces Radio Service. Petri

                <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention>."</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> The Petri Family -- "the family that took time / to bring
            you good wine" -- invites you to listen to <mention ref="watson">Dr. Watson</mention>
            tell us another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective,
                <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention>. And, while you're settling back
            comfortably in your chair, mind if I tell you about something I'd like you to share with
            me? It's a glass of Petri California sherry. Of course, most people think of Petri
            California sherry as the one wine that's really swell any time but, personally, I like a
            glass of that Petri sherry just before dinner. You know, that's the time you're a little
            on edge, you've just finished your day's work, and you're waiting for your dinner, and--
            Well, that's when you want to lean back and take it easy. And, boy, that's the time a
            glass of Petri sherry tastes like something just too good to be true. Try it. Petri
            sherry's the perfect before-dinner wine. And, incidentally, if you like your sherry dry
            -- you know, <!-- This was separated in the script -->not sweet? -- then you'll find
            that Petri pale dry sherry is just made for you. The important thing is the Petri label,
            because when it says "Petri," it always means good wine.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> And now for our weekly visit with our good friend and host,
                <mention ref="watson">Dr. Watson</mention>. Good evening, doctor.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Good evening, Mr. Bartell. You're a bit late. I've been
            keeping some dinner hot for you here. Pull up your chair and join me.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> That's very nice of you. Thanks, doctor. Are you all set
            with tonight's story?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Yes, my boy. I'm "all set" as you call it. As a matter of
            fact, I was going over my notes on the case just before you arrived.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Last week, you hinted that a beautiful girl figured
            prominently in your adventure.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> That's quite right, Mr. Bartell. An extremely beautiful girl.
            In fact, I often used to say to <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention> that if
            I'd been a little younger at the time, I might-- Oh, well, you haven't come here to
            listen to my personal reminiscences. You want to hear the story that I called "The
            Problem of Thor Bridge."</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> That's what you promised us, doctor. How did it begin?</ln>

        <ln pull="TB-p2"><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>NARRATES</stageDirect> On a windy morning in October -- in 1890, it was --
            as I was dressing, I observed how the last remaining leaves were being whirled away from
            the solitary plane tree which graced the yard behind our Baker Street house. I descended
            to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great
            artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. But, to my surprise, he was in an
            unusually gay mood. As I entered the room, he looked up at me and, with a smile, he
            spoke.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHEERY</stageDirect> Good morning, my dear fellow. I hope you slept
            well.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Splendidly, thanks,<mention ref="holmes">
            Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I'm so glad.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, you're very solicitous this morning. I - I think you
            must have got a new case. <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> Am I right?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious. Yes, I have
            a new case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation, the wheels revolve once
            more.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Good. Tell me all about it.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, as yet, there isn't much to tell. Have you ever heard of
            Neil Gibson?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Neil Gibson? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Something to do with gold
            mining, hasn't he?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> A great deal to do with it, my dear fellow. In fact, he's
            considered the greatest mining magnate in the world. About five years ago, he bought a
            large estate in Hampshire. Perhaps you've read of the tragic death of his wife.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, yes, of course. I remember the case now. She was murdered
            by a jealous governess who was in her employ, wasn't she?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> That point will be decided when the lady in question -- Grace
            Dunbar, I believe her name is -- comes up for trial at the forthcoming Winchester
            Assizes. In any case, it's hard to see what I can do for my client at this late
            date.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Your client?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, yes. I forgot I hadn't told you. I'm getting into your
            involved habit of telling a story backwards. You'd better read this letter; came this
            morning.</ln>

        <ln>
            <sound>RATTLE OF PAPER</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Let's have a look. <stageDirect>READS</stageDirect> "Dear Mr.
                <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention>, Miss Dunbar is innocent. I can't
            see the finest woman in the world go to her death without doing everything possible to
            save her. I shall call on you at ten-thirty to-morrow morning to discuss the matter.
            Yours faithfully, Neil Gibson." Good gracious me.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> There you have it,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>.
            That is the gentleman I await. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Do you know anything about his dead wife?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Only what I've been reading in the papers. Apparently, she was
            past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as this Miss Dunbar, who superintended
            the education of the two young children, is reputed to be a very attractive young
            lady.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> The eternal triangle, eh? Well, where did the murder
            take place?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> On Gibson's estate in Hampshire. His wife was found on the
            grounds nearly half a mile from the manor house, late at night, clad in her dinner
            dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and -- a revolver bullet through her brain. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Any weapon found near her?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> No, there were no clues found at the scene of the crime.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> What made them suspect the governess?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, in the first place, there was some very incriminating
            evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber -- the calibre corresponding with the
            bullet in the dead woman's head -- was found on the floor in Miss Dunbar's
            wardrobe.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, was it? Pretty damaging evidence,<mention ref="holmes">
                Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Mmm. So the coroner thought. And, to make the case even
            blacker against Miss Dunbar, the dead woman had a note on her making an appointment at
            that very spot -- and the note was signed by the governess.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> It seems obvious that the girl's guilty. And the motive's
            clear. Mr. Gibson would be a great catch for a young girl. Love, fortune, power -- all
            dependent on one life. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Possibly,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>, but
            circumstantial evidence can be very misleading at times.</ln>

            <sound>DOOR BELL JANGLES</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Ah, there's the gentleman in question, unless I'm very much
            mistaken, considerably before his time.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>OFF</stageDirect> Well, I can see him from the window here.
            Formidable-looking fellow. Must be well over six foot tall.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>LAUGHS</stageDirect> Judging by the way he's wrenching at that door bell,
            he's a man with a violent temper.</ln>

            <stageDirect>OFF</stageDirect> Mrs. Hudson's opening the door to him now.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Ah, meet him on the stairs, will you, old chap? It'll save
            Mrs. Hudson a journey.</ln>

            <stageDirect>OFF, TO WATSON</stageDirect> Are you Mr. <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>OFF</stageDirect> No, no, indeed. I'm his colleague <mention ref="watson"

        <ln>
            <sound>DOOR CLOSES ... FOOTSTEPS IN</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Mr. Neil Gibson, I presume?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> That's right. So you're the great <mention ref="holmes"
                >Sherlock Holmes</mention>, huh?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> The adjective is your own, Mr. Gibson. Sit down,
            won't you? By the way, you may speak quite freely in front of <mention ref="watson">Dr.
                Watson</mention>.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Hm. Well, I may as well begin by telling you that money means
            nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it's any use to you in lighting the
            truth. Miss Dunbar is innocent and it's up to you to prove it. Just name your fee.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Mr. Gibson, my professional charges are on a fixed scale. I
            don't vary them, except when I omit them altogether.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Very well. I imagine that you read the newspaper reports of
            the coroner's inquest.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Yes, very thoroughly.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> I don't see that I can add anything that'll help you. But if
            there are any questions you'd like to ask, I'll answer them.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, thank you. First, what were the exact relations between
            you and Miss Dunbar?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>TENSE</stageDirect> I suppose you're within your rights in asking such a
            question, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> We will agree to suppose so, shall we?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>UNCONVINCINGLY</stageDirect> Then I can assure you that my relations with
            Miss Dunbar were always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never
            conversed with, or ever saw, except in the company of his children.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>DISGUSTED</stageDirect> Ohh. <stageDirect>DISMISSIVE</stageDirect> I'm
            rather a busy man, Mr. Gibson, and I've no time or taste for aimless conversation. I
            wish you good-morning.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>ANGRY</stageDirect> What the devil do you mean by this, <mention
                ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> My dear sir, the case is difficult enough without your giving
            me false information.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Meaning that I lie, sir?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I was trying to express it as delicately as possible, but -
                <stageDirect>CLEARS THROAT</stageDirect> - if you insist on the word I won't
            contradict you.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Why, you confounded--!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Don't be noisy, Mr. Gibson. Please, don't be noisy. I find
            that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll
            in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> I suppose I can't make you take the case - but you've done
            yourself no good this morning, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>!

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> How did you know about his relations with the governess?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I didn't. It was pure bluff.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Bluff! <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> Well, it certainly
            worked. Think he'll come back?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, of course he will. He needs my help too badly. He'll
            probably change his mind before he's halfway down the stairs.</ln>

            back.</ln>

        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>APPROACHES</stageDirect> I've been thinking it over, <mention ref="holmes"
                >Mr. Holmes</mention>, and I feel that perhaps I was hasty in taking your remarks
            amiss. Just the same, I can assure you that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me
            really don't affect this case.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Surely, that is for me to decide, Mr. Gibson.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> You see, Mr. Gibson, my friend is like a doctor. He wants
            every symptom before he can give his diagnosis.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Fire away, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>. What is
            it you want to know?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> The truth.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> I can give it to you in a very few words. To begin with, I met
            my wife when I was gold-mining in Brazil. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Your wife was Brazilian by birth, wasn't she, sir?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Yes, doctor, and very beautiful. Well, to make a long story
            short, I fell in love and married her and brought her to England. After a few years, I
            realized that we had nothing -- absolutely nothing -- in common. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> And then, I suppose, this young governess, Miss Dunbar,
            arrived on the scene.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> That's right, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>.
            Well, the story should be obvious to you from there.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> You fell in love with this girl, I suppose, sir.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Who could help it?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Did you suggest marriage to her?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Yes. Though I knew that my wife would never divorce me.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I see. Then you made an utterly insincere proposition to
            her.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Now, look here, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>, I
            came to you on a question of evidence, not of morals. I'm not asking for your
            criticism.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> It's only the young lady's sake that forces me to touch your
            case at all. Now, tell me, sir. What is your own opinion as to Miss Dunbar's guilt?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> It's very black against her, I can't deny that. One
            explanation of the tragedy did come into my head, <mention ref="holmes">Mr.
                Holmes</mention>. I give it to you, for what it's worth. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Pray continue, Mr. Gibson.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> My wife was bitterly jealous. She was half-crazy with hatred.
            She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar -- or, we'll say, to threaten the girl with
            a revolver and so frighten her into leaving us. There might have been a struggle in
            which the gun exploded and gone off and shot my wife who was holding it.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, that possibility has already occurred to me. It's the
            only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> The revolver,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>. It was
            found on the floor of the governess' wardrobe.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Mr. Gibson, I should like to examine your house and the scene
            of the murder as soon as possible.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Certainly, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>.
            Sergeant Coventry of the local police is still down there. He'll give you any help you

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Oh, that's nice and friendly of you, doctor. Well, come on,

            It's not far from the 'ouse 'ere.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, I must say, Mr. Gibson has a beautiful estate. It must

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Oh, nearly twice that, doctor. The woods back o' the house
            there belongs to him, too. <stageDirect>BEAT</stageDirect> Mr. 'Olmes?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Yes, sergeant?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> There's a question I'd like to ask you. A question I
            wouldn't ask anyone else.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Then please ask it.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Don't you think there might be a case against Mr. Gibson
            hisself, sir?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I've been considering that possibility.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> That there Miss Dunbar's a bit of all right. If y'ask me, he
            wanted his wife out of the way. And the pistol she was shot with was his pistol, you
            know.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh? Was that fact proven?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Yes, doctor. It was one of a pair that he had.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> One of a pair? Where's the other?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Well, Mr. Gibson has a lot of firearms. We never quite
            matched that particular pistol -- but the box was made for two.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, if it was one of a pair, surely you'd be able to match
            it.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Well, we 'ave 'em all laid out at the house if you want to
            look 'em over.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> We'll do that later. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Ah! This, I presume, is Thor Bridge.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> That's right, sir. Found Mrs. Gibson's body lying right here
            at the approach to the bridge. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I see. I gathered from the newspaper reports that the shot was
            fired at very close quarters.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Yes, sir, very close.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Near the right temple, wasn't it?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Just behind it, sir.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> How did the body lie, sergeant?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Oh, on its back, doctor. No trace of a struggle. No marks.
            No weapon. The note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Clutched, you say?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers to get at
            it.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Ah, that's of greatest importance. It excludes the idea that
            anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> What did the note say, sergeant?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Little enough, doctor. It just said, uh, "I will be at Thor
            Bridge at nine o'clock" and it was signed "Grace Dunbar."</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Oh, yes, sir.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> What was her explanation?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> She wouldn't say nothing. Said she was saving her defence
            for the trial.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Yes, it seems odd that Mrs. Gibson was still clutching that
            note.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Seems perfectly natural to me.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, come now, old fellow, argue the thing out logically. If
            the letter is genuine, it was certainly received some time before the tragedy -- say an
            hour or two. Why, then, was the dead woman still clasping it in her left hand? Why
            should she carry it so carefully? She certainly didn't need to refer to the note at all
            at the interview. Doesn't it strike you as rather strange?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, now, you put it that way, it does seem a little
            peculiar.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Yes,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>, I don't see how
            it could have any connection with Mrs. Gibson's murder.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, perhaps it hasn't. But it's a point worth noting. There
            were no footprints, you say, sergeant?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> None, Mr. 'Olmes. The ground was as hard as iron. It's been
            a very dry summer and we haven't had any rain to speak of.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> That's a pity. Hmm. Well, sergeant, I'm much obliged to you
            and now I think we'll go back to the house.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Right. Cesar'll show you where the firearms are, sir.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, uh, who is Cesar?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Oh, a funny kind of a bloke. Brazilian, I guess.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Brazilian, eh? Like Mrs. Gibson?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Yes, Mr. 'Olmes. Comes from the same town as she does, as a
            matter of fact. Something very fishy about 'im, if you ask me. Now, if you'll excuse me,
            gentlemen, I'm going to take a little stroll around the grounds. You've started me on a

            all of us were afraid of him. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Did you ever witness physical violence towards Mrs.

        <ln><speaker>CESAR</speaker> No, señor, I cannot say that I have. But I have heard him say
            many terrible things to her. He would taunt her in front of we servants. I have heard

            <stageDirect>TAKEN ABACK</stageDirect> Upon my soul,<mention ref="holmes">

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I think not, old chap.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Huh?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it, we
            must suspect deception.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> I don't quite follow you.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of
            a woman who, in cold, premeditated fashion, is about to murder a rival. You've planned
            it. A note has been written. The victim has come. You have a weapon. The crime is well
            done. It has been workmanlike and complete. Do you mean to tell me that after carrying
            out so crafty a crime you'd be so stupid as to forget to fling the incriminating
            revolver to the bottom of the stream? Or perhaps in the dense reeds that border it?
            Would you carefully carry it home and put it in the first place that would be searched?
            Your wardrobe?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, perhaps in the excitement of the moment--</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> No, no, my dear chap, I won't admit that's even possible. When
            a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated
            also. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well then, if Miss Dunbar didn't shoot Mrs. Gibson, who the
            devil did?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I hope I can give you the answer to that question,<mention
                ref="watson"> Watson</mention>, when we've made one further visit.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> We did, Mr. Bartell. An hour later found the two of us sitting
            in a dank and gloomy cell talking to one of the most beautiful girls that I've ever
            seen. Her bright, flashing eyes and her air of quiet confidence seemed sadly out of
            place in such a setting.<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention> spoke to her, quietly
            soothing her.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Miss Dunbar, tell us of your true relations with the dead
            woman.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> She hated me, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>. She
            hated me with all the passion of her distorted mind.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Please tell us exactly what happened on the evening of Mrs.
            Gibson's death.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Well, I - I received a note from her in the morning, a note
            imploring me to meet her at the bridge after dinner that night. She said she had
            something important to say to me.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Did you keep that note, Miss Dunbar?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> No, doctor. She-- Well, she asked me to destroy the note, so I
            burned it in the schoolroom grate. I saw no reason for such secrecy but-- Well, I - I
            did as she asked.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Hmm. And yet she kept your reply very carefully. That's
            interesting. Tell me what happened when you met her that night.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> When I reached the bridge, she was waiting for me. I - I won't
            tell you what she said. But she poured out her whole, wild fury in burning, horrible
            words. I did not [even answer] -- I couldn't. It was dreadful even to look at her. She
            was like an insane woman, standing there screaming disgusting insults at me. I - I put
            my hands to my ears and rushed away. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Where was she standing when you left her? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Within a few yards of the spot where her body was found
            later.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> And yet, presuming she met her death shortly after you left
            her, you heard no shot?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> No. No, I heard nothing. But I was so upset, <mention
                ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>, that I rushed straight back to my room.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Did you leave it again that night?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Yes. When the alarm came that Mrs. Gibson was dead, I ran out
            with the others.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Did you see Mr. Gibson?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Yes, doctor. He had just returned from the bridge when I saw
            him. He had sent for the doctor and the police.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> This pistol that [was] found in your room. Had you ever seen
            it before?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Never, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>, I swear
            it.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> When was it found, Miss Dunbar?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Next morning, when the police made their search. It was on the
            floor of my wardrobe where I keep my shoes.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Hm. You've no idea how long it had been there?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Well, it hadn't been there the morning before.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> How do you know?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Because I tidied up the wardrobe that day.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I see. Then someone must have come into your room and placed
            the pistol there in order to incriminate you.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> I'm certain of it.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, when - when could they have done that?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Well, it - it could have been at meal-time, or when I was in
            the schoolroom with the children.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Yes. Miss Dunbar, on examining the scene of Mrs. Gibson's
            death, I noticed that a piece of stonework on the underside of the parapet of the bridge
            had been broken away. Can you suggest any possible explanation for that?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Oh, surely, it must have been a mere coincidence, Mr. <mention
                ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Possibly. But why should it appear at the very time of the

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> What have you found out, <mention ref="holmes">Mr.
                Holmes</mention>?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> The answer to this mystery I hope, my dear young lady. You
            will get news before the day is out. And meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are
            lifting and that the light of truth is breaking through!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Well, Mr. 'Olmes, you're soon back here. What have you found
            out?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Tell you in a few moments. You got my message?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Yes, here you are, a ball of twine. What you want it for, I
            can't imagine.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> You'll soon see, sergeant. Uh,<mention ref="watson">
                Watson</mention>, I, uh, have some recollection that you usually go armed on these
            excursions of ours.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Yes, I'm carrying my revolver. Why?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Give it to me, old chap, will you? Thanks. I believe your
            revolver may have a very intimate connection with the mystery we're investigating.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> You're joking.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> No,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>, I'm very serious.
            We have a test to make. If the test is successful, Miss Dunbar will be free before
            nightfall. And the test will depend on the conduct of this revolver of yours. </ln>

        <ln>
            <sound>HOLMES UNLOADS BULLETS FROM REVOLVER</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I take the precaution of unloading it. Uh huh. There we are.
            Now, sergeant, ball of twine, please.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Wish I knew what you was up to, sir.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I tie one end of the twine -- like this -- to the handle of
            the revolver. So. Sergeant, see if you can find me a heavy stone, will you?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Right you are, sir.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker><mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>, what are you
            doing?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Trying to reconstruct the killing of Mrs. Gibson. But you've
            seen me miss the mark before,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>. I have an instinct
            for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when it
            first flashed across my mind in Miss Dunbar's cell, but one drawback of an active mind
            is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a
            false one. And yet-- Oh, well. We can but try.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Here's a nice stone, <mention ref="holmes">Mr.
                Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Thank you, sergeant! Now! I tie the other end of this twine to
            a stone. Wait a minute. Like that. Splendid! Uh, sergeant, will you please take this
            stone and stretch the twine across the parapet of the bridge there -- so that the stone
            will swing just clear of the water on the other side of the bridge?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Right you are, sir.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I'll stand on the spot where Mrs. Gibson's body was found.
                <stageDirect>CALLS</stageDirect> That's it, sergeant. Over the parapet.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker>
            <stageDirect>OFF</stageDirect> All set, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>. The
            stone's swinging about eight feet above the water.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Splendid! Now,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>, watch
            closely. I raise the revolver to my head.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Careful,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>, careful.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Don't worry, old chap, it's not loaded. Now, let us imagine I
            am the late Mrs. Gibson. I raise the revolver to my head and fire it.</ln>

        <ln>
            <sound>CLICK OF EMPTY REVOLVER</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Instantly, my fingers release their grip and--</ln>

        <ln>
            <sound>GUN RATTLES ACROSS BRIDGE ... LOUD CLANG AS METAL GUN HITS STONE PARAPET ...
                SPLASHES AS STONE AND GUN SINK INTO STREAM</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> There's your answer,<mention ref="watson">
            Watson</mention>!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Great Scott! The revolver flashed back out of your hand --
            struck the parapet of the bridge -- and then the weight of the stone flipped it over
            into the water!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Was there ever a more exact demonstration? Come on, old
            fellow!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> You're a bloomin' magician, Mr. 'Olmes! That's what you are,
            a bloomin' magician!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Look at that! There's the second chip on the stonework of the
            parapet here -- same size as the first! </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Then the murder of Mrs. Gibson--?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Wasn't murder at all! It was suicide!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> What?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> We can follow the various steps quite clearly. A note was
            extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar. A note which made it appear that she had
            chosen the scene of the crime. Mrs. Gibson, in her anxiety that the note should be
            discovered, somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. That alone should
            have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Then she stole one of her husband's revolvers--! </ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> And planted the other one in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Exactly! After discharging one of the cartridges, which she
            could easily do in the woods without attracting suspicion, she then went down to the
            bridge where she contrived this exceedingly ingenious method of getting rid of her
            weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared, she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred,
            and then, when the girl had left, carried out her terrible purpose. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Then the missing revolver--?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> You'll find it, with the aid of a grappling hook, at the
            bottom of the stream, and also the stone and the string, with which this vindictive
            woman attempted to disguise her own crime and fasten a charge of murder on an innocent
            victim. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Yes, sergeant, and don't forget, while you're at it, that my
            revolver's down there, too.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker>
            <stageDirect>MOVING OFF</stageDirect> Oh, don't worry, doctor. I'll get some grappling
            hooks right away.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> I must say,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>,
            you've solved this case brilliantly. Quite brilliantly.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Ah, I disagree, old chap. And I fear that you will not improve
            my reputation by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, nonsense. But that's ridiculous.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, no, it isn't, old boy. I've been sluggish in my mind --
            and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the very basis of my
            art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true
            solution, and I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>, personally, I
            agree with the sergeant's opinion of you.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh? What was that, old fellow?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>MIMICS THE SERGEANT</stageDirect> You're a bloomin' magician, Mr. 'Olmes!
            That's what you are, a bloomin' magician! <stageDirect>LAUGHS</stageDirect></ln>

            <music>TO A FINISH</music>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Well, doctor,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention> really
            was a magician -- that is, if you did find Mrs. Gibson's revolver, and your own, in the
            stream.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> Oh, we found them all right. You don't think I'd
            tell you the story otherwise, do you? What do you take me for, anyway?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Well, now that you ask, I'll tell you. I take you for a
            very charming gentleman, a wonderful storyteller, and a fine host.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>BURBLES IN EMBARRASSMENT</stageDirect> Oh, really, I--</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Well, you are a gentleman, of the old school.</ln>

        <ln>
            <speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>MORE BURBLING</stageDirect>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> And you do tell a fine story.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> You flatter me. You--</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> And you are a perfect host. That meal we had tonight was
            wonderful.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, it was?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> And, um, that - that wine. What kind was it?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>STOPS BURBLING, REPROVING</stageDirect> It was Petri Wine, and you know
            it.</ln>

        <ln>
            <speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> And I should have known you were leading up to something. Mr.
            Bartell, you should be ashamed of yourself. You'll do anything to get a chance to talk
            about Petri Wine. Though I can't say that I blame you.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Oh, honestly, doctor, I meant everything I said. But you
            don't really want me to stop talking about Petri Wine, do you? After all, it's worth
            talking about, isn't it? What other wine is made with the loving care that goes into
            Petri Wine? Don't forget, Petri Wine is made by the Petri Family. Winemaking is their
            business. Why, they've been making wine for generations, handing down -- from father to
            son, from father to son -- all their skill and knowledge and experience. You can be sure
            the Petri Family really knows plenty about the fine art of turning luscious grapes into
            delicious wine. That's why, whether you want a wine for before dinner, with dinner, or
            for any time, you can't go wrong with a Petri Wine. "Because Petri took time / to bring
            you good wine." And now, <mention ref="watson">Dr. Watson</mention>, what new story are
            you planning to tell us next week?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, next week, Mr. Bartell, I'm going to tell an adventure
                that<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention> and I had amid the Oriental magnificence
            of a maharaja's palace in India.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> India? Sounds intriguing. What were you and <mention
                ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention> doing out there, doctor?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, well, you'll have to wait till next week for the answer to
            that question, my boy. But I can tell you that it was one of the weirdest problems that
            we ever had to solve. I call the story, "The Vanishing Elephant."</ln>
