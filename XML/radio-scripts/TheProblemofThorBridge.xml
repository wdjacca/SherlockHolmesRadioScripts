                <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention>."</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> The Petri Family -- "the family that took time / to bring
            you good wine" -- invites you to listen to <mention ref="watson">Dr. Watson</mention>
            tell us another exciting adventure he shared with his old friend, that master detective,
                <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention>. And, while you're settling back
            comfortably in your chair, mind if I tell you about something I'd like you to share with
            me? It's a glass of Petri California sherry. Of course, most people think of Petri
            California sherry as the one wine that's really swell any time but, personally, I like a
            glass of that Petri sherry just before dinner. You know, that's the time you're a little
            on edge, you've just finished your day's work, and you're waiting for your dinner, and--
            Well, that's when you want to lean back and take it easy. And, boy, that's the time a
            glass of Petri sherry tastes like something just too good to be true. Try it. Petri
            sherry's the perfect before-dinner wine. And, incidentally, if you like your sherry dry
            -- you know, <!-- This was separated in the script -->not sweet? -- then you'll find
            that Petri pale dry sherry is just made for you. The important thing is the Petri label,
            because when it says "Petri," it always means good wine.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> And now for our weekly visit with our good friend and host,
                <mention ref="watson">Dr. Watson</mention>. Good evening, doctor.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Good evening, Mr. Bartell. You're a bit late. I've been
            keeping some dinner hot for you here. Pull up your chair and join me.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> That's very nice of you. Thanks, doctor. Are you all set
            with tonight's story?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Yes, my boy. I'm "all set" as you call it. As a matter of
            fact, I was going over my notes on the case just before you arrived.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Last week, you hinted that a beautiful girl figured
            prominently in your adventure.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> That's quite right, Mr. Bartell. An extremely beautiful girl.
            In fact, I often used to say to <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention> that if
            I'd been a little younger at the time, I might-- Oh, well, you haven't come here to
            listen to my personal reminiscences. You want to hear the story that I called "The
            Problem of Thor Bridge."</ln>

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> That's what you promised us, doctor. How did it begin?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p2" change="wording"><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>NARRATES</stageDirect> On a windy morning in October -- in 1890, it was --
            as I was dressing, I observed how the last remaining leaves were being whirled away from
            the solitary plane tree which graced the yard behind our Baker Street house. I descended
            to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great
            artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. But, to my surprise, he was in an
            unusually gay mood. As I entered the room, he looked up at me and, with a smile, he
            spoke.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHEERY</stageDirect> Good morning, <mention ref="watson">my dear fellow</mention>. I hope you slept
            well.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Splendidly, thanks,<mention ref="holmes">
            Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I'm so glad.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p3" change="wording"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, you're very solicitous this morning. I - I think you
            must have got a new case. <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> Am I right?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p4"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious. Yes, I have
            a new case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation, the wheels revolve once
            more.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Good. Tell me all about it.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p8" change="wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, as yet, there isn't much to tell. Have you ever heard of
            Neil Gibson?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Neil Gibson? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Something to do with gold
            mining, hasn't he?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p10-s1 #TB-p12" change="wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> A great deal to do with it, <mention ref="watson">my dear fellow</mention>. In fact, he's
            considered the greatest mining magnate in the world. About five years ago, he bought a
            large estate in Hampshire. Perhaps you've read of the tragic death of his wife.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p13" change="sig"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, yes, of course. I remember the case now. She was murdered
            by a jealous governess who was in her employ, wasn't she?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p15-s1 #TB-p15-s2" change="wording interpel"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> That point will be decided when the lady in question -- <mention ref="Dunbar">Grace
            Dunbar</mention>, I believe her name is -- comes up for trial at the forthcoming Winchester
            Assizes. In any case, it's hard to see what I can do for my client at this late
            date.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p16"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Your client?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p17"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, yes. I forgot I hadn't told you. I'm getting into your
            involved habit of telling a story backwards. You'd better read this letter; came this
            morning.</ln>

        <ln>

        </ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p18" change="sig"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Let's have a look. <stageDirect>READS</stageDirect> "Dear Mr.
                <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention>, <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention> is innocent. I can't
            see the finest woman in the world go to her death without doing everything possible to
            save her. I shall call on you at ten-thirty to-morrow morning to discuss the matter.
            Yours faithfully, Neil Gibson." Good gracious me.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p19-s1 TB-p19-s2"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> There you have it,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>.
            That is the gentleman I await. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Do you know anything about his dead wife?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p19-s3" change="interpel sig"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Only what I've been reading in the papers. Apparently, she was
            past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as this <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>, who superintended
            the education of the two young children, is reputed to be a very attractive young
            lady.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> The eternal triangle, eh? Well, where did the murder
            take place?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p19-s4 TB-p19-s5" change="wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> On Gibson's estate in Hampshire. His wife was found on the
            grounds nearly half a mile from the manor house, late at night, clad in her dinner
            dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and -- a revolver bullet through her brain. </ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p19-s4" change="sig wording"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Any weapon found near her?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p19-s4" change="sig wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> No, there were no clues found at the scene of the crime.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p20" change="wording sig"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> What made them suspect the governess?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p21-s1"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, in the first place, there was some very incriminating
            evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber -- the calibre corresponding with the
            bullet in the dead woman's head -- was found on the floor in <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>'s
            wardrobe.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, was it? Pretty damaging evidence,<mention ref="holmes">
                Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p21-s2" change="sig"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Mmm. So the coroner thought. And, to make the case even
            blacker against <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>, the dead woman had a note on her making an appointment at
            that very spot -- and the note was signed by the governess.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p21-s3" change="wording"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> It seems obvious that the girl's guilty. And the motive's
            clear. Mr. Gibson would be a great catch for a young girl. Love, fortune, power -- all
            dependent on one life. </ln>

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Possibly,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>, but
            circumstantial evidence can be very misleading at times.</ln>

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig interpel"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> That's right. So you're the great <mention ref="holmes"

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig interpel"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> The adjective is your own, Mr. Gibson. Sit down,
            won't you? By the way, you may speak quite freely in front of <mention ref="watson">Dr.
                Watson</mention>.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p38"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Hm. Well, I may as well begin by telling you that money means
            nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it's any use to you in lighting the
            truth. <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention> is innocent and it's up to you to prove it. Just name your fee.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p39"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Mr. Gibson, my professional charges are on a fixed scale. I
            don't vary them, except when I omit them altogether.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p42" change="wording"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Very well. I imagine that you read the newspaper reports of
            the coroner's inquest.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Yes, very thoroughly.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p42" change="wording"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> I don't see that I can add anything that'll help you. But if
            there are any questions you'd like to ask, I'll answer them.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p45"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, thank you. First, what were the exact relations between

        <ln pull="#TB-p47"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>TENSE</stageDirect> I suppose you're within your rights in asking such a
            question, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p48"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> We will agree to suppose so, shall we?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p49"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>UNCONVINCINGLY</stageDirect> Then I can assure you that my relations with
            <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention> were always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never
            conversed with, or ever saw, except in the company of his children.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p58"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I was trying to express it as delicately as possible, but -

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Your wife was Brazilian by birth, wasn't she, <mention ref="gibson">sir</mention>?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p80-s2 TB-p80-s3" change="wording sig"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Yes, doctor, and very beautiful. Well, to make a long story
            short, I fell in love and married her and brought her to England. After a few years, I
            realized that we had nothing -- absolutely nothing -- in common. </ln>

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig interpel"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> And then, I suppose, this young governess, <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>,

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig interpel"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> That's right, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>.
            Well, the story should be obvious to you from there.</ln>

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig interpel"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> You fell in love with this girl, I suppose, <mention ref="gibson">sir</mention>.</ln>

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> Who could help it?</ln>

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Did you suggest marriage to her?</ln>

        <ln type="unmatched" change="sig interpel"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I see. Then you made an utterly insincere proposition to

        <ln pull="#TB-p89-s1 TB-p96" change="wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> It's only the young lady's sake that forces me to touch your

        <ln pull="#TB-p98-s1 TB-p98-s2"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> It's very black against her, I can't deny that. One

        <ln pull="#TB-p98-s3 TB-p98-s4" change="sig interpel wording"><speaker>GIBSON</speaker> My wife was bitterly jealous. She was half-crazy with hatred.
            She might have planned to murder <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention> -- or, we'll say, to threaten the girl with
            a revolver and so frighten her into leaving us. There might have been a struggle in

        <ln pull="#TB-p99 TB-p100"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Well, that possibility has already occurred to me. It's the

        <ln pull="#TB-p131"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Clutched, you say?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p132"><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Yes, <mention ref="holmes">sir</mention>, we could hardly open the fingers to get at

        <ln pull="#TB-p133-s1"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Ah, that's of greatest importance. It excludes the idea that

        <ln pull="#TB-p133-s2" change="wording interpel"><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Little enough, doctor. It just said, uh, "I will be at Thor

        <ln pull="#TB-p135"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Did <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention> admit writing it?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p138" change="wording interpel"><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> She wouldn't say nothing. Said she was saving her defence

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Yes, it seems odd that Mrs. Gibson was still clutching that

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Seems perfectly natural to me.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p141" change="wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, come now, <mention ref="watson">old fellow</mention>, argue the thing out logically. If
            the letter is genuine, it was certainly received some time before the tragedy -- say an
            hour or two. Why, then, was the dead woman still clasping it in her left hand? Why
            should she carry it so carefully? She certainly didn't need to refer to the note at all

            revolver to the bottom of the stream? Or perhaps in the dense reeds that border it?
            Would you carefully carry it home and put it in the first place that would be searched?
            Your wardrobe?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p163"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, perhaps in the excitement of the moment--</ln>

            soothing her.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p173"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>, tell us of your true relations with the dead
            woman.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p174-s1"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> She hated me, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>. She

        <ln pull="#TB-p175"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Please tell us exactly what happened on the evening of Mrs.

        <ln pull="#TB-p178-s1 TB-p178-s2" change="wording"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Well, I - I received a note from her in the morning, a note
            imploring me to meet her at the bridge after dinner that night. She said she had
            something important to say to me.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Did you keep that note, <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p178-s3"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> No, <mention ref="watson">doctor</mention>. She-- Well, she asked me to destroy the note, so I
            burned it in the schoolroom grate. I saw no reason for such secrecy but-- Well, I - I
            did as she asked.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p179"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Hmm. And yet she kept your reply very carefully. That's
            interesting. Tell me what happened when you met her that night.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p182" change="wording"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> When I reached the bridge, she was waiting for me. I - I won't
            tell you what she said. But she poured out her whole, wild fury in burning, horrible
            words. I did not [even answer] -- I couldn't. It was dreadful even to look at her. She
            was like an insane woman, standing there screaming disgusting insults at me. I - I put
            my hands to my ears and rushed away. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Where was she standing when you left her? </ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p184"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Within a few yards of the spot where her body was found

        <ln pull="#TB-p185"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> And yet, presuming she met her death shortly after you left
            her, you heard no shot?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> No. No, I heard nothing. But I was so upset, <mention

        <ln pull="#TB-p187-s1"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Did you leave it again that night?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p188" change="interpel"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Yes. When the alarm came that Mrs. Gibson was dead, I ran out

        <ln pull="#TB-p190"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Yes, <mention ref="watson">doctor</mention>. He had just returned from the bridge when I saw

        <ln pull="#TB-p193-s1"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> This pistol that [was] found in your room. Had you ever seen

        <ln pull="#TB-p196 TB-p197 TB-p198" change="wording"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Next morning, when the police made their search. It was on the

        <ln pull="#TB-p199"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Hm. You've no idea how long it had been there?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p200"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Well, it hadn't been there the morning before.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p201"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> How do you know?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p202"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Because I tidied up the wardrobe that day.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p203" change="wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> I see. Then someone must have come into your room and placed

        <ln pull="#TB-p204" change="wording"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> I'm certain of it.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p205" change="wording"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well, when - when could they have done that?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p206"><speaker>DUNBAR</speaker> Well, it - it could have been at meal-time, or when I was in

        <ln pull="#TB-p211" change="wording"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Yes. <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>, on examining the scene of Mrs. Gibson's

        <ln pull="#TB-p213 TB-p216"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Possibly. But why should it appear at the very time of the

        <ln pull="#TB-p241-s1"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Was there ever a more exact demonstration? Come on, old

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> You're a bloomin' magician, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. 'Olmes</mention>! That's what you are,
            a bloomin' magician!</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p241-s2"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Look at that! There's the second chip on the stonework of the

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Then the murder of Mrs. Gibson--?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Wasn't murder at all! It was suicide!</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> What?</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p246"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> We can follow the various steps quite clearly. A note was
            extracted very cleverly from <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>. A note which made it appear that she had
            chosen the scene of the crime. Mrs. Gibson, in her anxiety that the note should be
            discovered, somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. That alone should
            have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p247"><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Then she stole one of her husband's revolvers--! </ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p247"><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> And planted the other one in <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention>'s wardrobe!</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p247"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Exactly! After discharging one of the cartridges, which she
            could easily do in the woods without attracting suspicion, she then went down to the
            bridge where she contrived this exceedingly ingenious method of getting rid of her
            weapon. When <mention ref="dunbar">Miss Dunbar</mention> appeared, she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred,
            and then, when the girl had left, carried out her terrible purpose. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker> Then the missing revolver--?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> You'll find it, with the aid of a grappling hook, at the
            bottom of the stream, and also the stone and the string, with which this vindictive
            woman attempted to disguise her own crime and fasten a charge of murder on an innocent
            victim. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Yes, sergeant, and don't forget, while you're at it, that my
            revolver's down there, too.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker>
            <stageDirect>MOVING OFF</stageDirect> Oh, don't worry, doctor. I'll get some grappling
            hooks right away.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>
            <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> I must say,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>,
            you've solved this case brilliantly. Quite brilliantly.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p244"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Ah, I disagree, <mention ref="watson">old chap</mention> And I fear that you will not improve
            my reputation by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Oh, nonsense. But that's ridiculous.</ln>

        <ln pull="#TB-p244"><speaker>HOLMES</speaker> Oh, no, it isn't, old boy. I've been sluggish in my mind --
            and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the very basis of my
            art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true
            solution, and I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker> Well,<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention>, personally, I

        <ln><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Oh, honestly, doctor, I meant everything I said. But you
            don't really want me to stop talking about Petri Wine, do you? After all, it's worth
            talking about, isn't it? What other wine is made with the loving care that goes into
            Petri Wine? Don't forget, Petri Wine is made by the Petri Family. Winemaking is their
            business. Why, they've been making wine for generations, handing down -- from father to
            son, from father to son -- all their skill and knowledge and experience. You can be sure
            the Petri Family really knows plenty about the fine art of turning luscious grapes into
            delicious wine. That's why, whether you want a wine for before dinner, with dinner, or
            for any time, you can't go wrong with a Petri Wine. "Because Petri took time / to bring
            you good wine." And now, <mention ref="watson">Dr. Watson</mention>, what new story are
