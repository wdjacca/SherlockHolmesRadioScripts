        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker><stageDirect>NARRATES</stageDirect> Many of the cases of
            <mention ref="holmes">Sherlock Holmes</mention> were private affairs that made no stir outside the family circles
            involved, but the disappearance of Silver Blaze was a matter which set the whole country
            by the ears -- for not merely had this horse, the favorite for the Wessex Cup, vanished
            for a week before the great race, but his trainer had also been tragically
            murdered.</ln>

            usual and the stables locked up at nine o'clock. Two of the lads walked up to the
            trainer's house where they had supper in the kitchen whilst the third, Ned Hunter,
            remained on guard. A few minutes after nine, the maid, Edith Baxter, carried his supper,
            a dish of curried mutton, down to the stables. As the path ran over the open moor, she
            carried a lantern with her. About thirty yards away from the stables a man appeared out
            of the darkness and called to her to stop." </ln>

                maid hurried towards the house. But, looking back, she saw the stranger leaning in
                through the stable window. A minute later when Hunter rushed out with the dog, the
                stranger was gone." (TO HOLMES</stageDirect> Yes, um-- That's as far as we can get
            with the Morning Post, I'm afraid. Mrs. Hudson very stupidly used the other half of the
            paper to light the fire this morning. I - I'm sorry.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker><stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> Oh, no matter, my dear

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Er-- <stageDirect>READS) "Hunter, on the return of his fellow
                grooms, sent a message up to the trainer, Straker, to tell him what had happened.
                Straker seems to have been vaguely uneasy about the matter, for although he'd been
                to bed he got up again at one o'clock in the morning telling his wife that he was
                going down to the stable to see if all was well. He put on a mackintosh, for it was
                raining heavily, and left the house." (TO WATSON</stageDirect> Hm! Quite a wealth of
            detail, my dear<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>. And here I have the notes of Mrs. Straker's statement. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker><stageDirect>READS</stageDirect> "After her husband had gone
            out she went back to sleep again and didn't wake until seven o'clock in the morning.
            Finding him still absent, she called the maid and they set off together for the stables.
            They found the door wide open. Inside, huddled on a chair, was Hunter in a state of
            complete stupor. The lads in the loft overhead had heard nothing all night, but the
            favorite's stall was empty and there was no sign of the trainer."</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>Hunter had obviously being drugged! </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Undoubtedly. <stageDirect>READS) "Mrs. Straker and the maid
                left him and ran up to the moor to see whether Straker had merely taken the horse
                out for exercise. And so the murder was discovered." (TO WATSON</stageDirect>

            <sound>RUSTLE OF NOTES</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>Oh. Well-- Yes, here it is. Er-- <stageDirect>READS) "Some
                quarter of a mile from the stables Mrs. Straker and the maid found Straker's coat
                flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond, there was a bowl-shaped depression
                on the moor, and at the bottom of this John Straker's body was found -- his head
                shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon; wounded in the thigh, a long
                clean cut evidently inflicted by some sharp instrument. Straker had obviously tried
                to defend himself, for in his left hand he grasped a red and black silk cravat which
                was recognized by the maid as having been worn by the stranger who'd spoken to her
                outside the stables. Hunter, the stable boy, also identified it when he'd recovered
                from the effects of the drug. This was apparently powdered opium which had been put
                into his curried mutton." (TO HOLMES</stageDirect> Now that - that explains what the
            stranger was doing as he leant through the stable window--</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker><stageDirect>AGREES</stageDirect> Mm hm. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>--for the lads who et the same meal at the trainer's house were
            quite all right, so only one plate had been drugged. It goes on to say there were
            abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that the missing
            horse, Silver Blaze, had been there at the time of the struggle. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Well,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>, that has passed our little journey quite
            agreeably. And here we are at Tavistock. </ln>

        <ln>
            <sound>TRAIN PULLS TO A STOP ... PASSENGERS BUSTLE ... SCENE FADES OUT</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker><stageDirect>NARRATES</stageDirect> Tavistock lies like the
            boss of a shield in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were
            waiting for us at the station -- Silver Blaze's owner, the well-known sportsman Colonel
            Ross, and Inspector Gregory of Scotland Yard. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker>I'm delighted that you've come down, <mention ref="holmes">Mr. Holmes</mention>. The inspector
            here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone
            unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and recover my horse.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>I trust that I may be able to assist you, sir. Has there been
            any fresh development?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>I'm sorry to say we've made very little progress. As you
            know, we've had no difficulty in tracing the stranger. He was well known in the
            neighborhood. His name is, er, Fitzroy Simpson, a man who's come down in the world and,
            er, lives by a little quiet and genteel bookmaking in the London clubs. His books showed
            he was carrying bets up to five thousand pounds against the favorite. When confronted
            with the cravat he turned very pale and was utterly unable to account for its presence
            in the hand of the murdered man.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>Of course Straker himself was wounded, wasn't he? In the thigh.
            He may have wounded himself in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Excellent, my dear<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>. It's more than possible; it's
            probable. In which case one of the main points in favor of the accused disappears. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker><stageDirect>NARRATES</stageDirect> A minute later we were all
            seated in a comfortable landau and were rolling through the quaint old Devonshire town. </ln>

        <ln>
            <sound>FADE IN CLIP-CLOP OF HORSE AND MOVING LANDAU BACKGROUND</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker><stageDirect>TO INSPECTOR) A clever counsel would tear your
                case to rags. Why should Simpson take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to
                injure it, he could do it there. Has a duplicate key to the stable door been found
                in his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could
                he -- he, a stranger to the district -- hide a horse? And such a horse as this!
                (BEAT</stageDirect> Tell me, what is his own explanation as to the note which he
            wished the maid to give to the stable boy? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>He says it was a ten-pound note, and one was found in his
            purse. Also, he's not a stranger to the district; he's twice lodged at Tavistock in the
            summer. The opium he probably brought with him from London. The key, having served its
            term, will be hurled away. As for the horse, he may well lie at the bottom of one of the
            pits or old mines upon the moor.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>What does he say about the cravat?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>He admits that it's his and says that he lost it. But a new
            element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse
            from the stables. We found traces that show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday
            night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they were gone.
            Simpson may well have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Mmm, it's certainly possible. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>Eh, the moor is being scoured for them. Meanwhile I've
            examined every stable and outhouse in Tavistock and for a radius of ten miles. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>There's another training stable quite close, I believe. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>Yes, and that's a factor we must certainly not neglect. As
            Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the
            disappearance of Silver Blaze. Silas Brown, their trainer, is known to have had large
            bets upon the event and he was no friend to poor Straker. However, we've examined his
            stables and there's nothing to connect him with the affair.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>And nothing to connect Fitzroy Simpson with their
            interests?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>Nothing at all. Ah, well, here we are. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker><stageDirect>NARRATES</stageDirect> Our driver pulled up at a
            little red-brick villa which stood by the road. Colonel Ross asked<mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention> whether he
            would like to go on to the scene of the crime.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>No, I think I prefer to stay here a little while and go into
            one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I suppose. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker>Yes, he lies upstairs. The inquest is tomorrow.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>He's been in your service some years, Colonel? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker>I've always found him an excellent servant. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>I have the things themselves here in the sitting room. </ln>

            candle, pencil case, a few papers, and the ivory-handled knife. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Yea. A very singular knife,<mention ref="watson"> Watson</mention>. Surely in your line.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>It's what we call a cataract knife. We use it for surgical
            purposes, including very delicate operations. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>A strange thing for a man to carry with him on a rough
            expedition. Why, it won't even shut up to go into his pocket.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>Er, the tip was guarded by a cork which we found beside his
            body. His wife tells us that he kept it for some days on the dressing table and picked
            it up as he left the room. A poor weapon, but perhaps the best he could lay his hands on
            at the moment. </ln>

            brought us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink of it was the
            furze-bush upon which the mackintosh belonging to the murdered man had been hung.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>There was no wind that night, I understand. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>None; but very heavy rain.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Well, in that case the coat was not blown against the

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>Yes, it was laid across the bush.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Very interesting.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker><stageDirect>NARRATES</stageDirect><mention ref="holmes"> Holmes</mention> took the bag and,

            to miss it! </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>It was invisible; buried in the mud. I only found it because I
            was looking for it. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>What? You expected to find it?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>I thought it not unlikely. You'll have searched the ferns
            around the rim of the hollow for any more tracks, of course. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>INSPECTOR</speaker>I'm afraid there are none. I've examined the ground very
            carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Good. Then I'll take a little walk over the moors before it

            to Capleton yonder. Why should he run wild upon the moor? As he's not at King's Pyland,

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>He has the horse, then?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Oh, he tried to bluster it out, but I told him so exactly what
            his actions had been that morning that he's convinced I was actually watching him.
                <stageDirect>CHUCKLES</stageDirect> He was first down as usual and, seeing a strange
            horse wandering on the moor, he went out to it. When he recognized it as Silver Blaze --
            from the white splash on its forehead -- his first instinct was to return it to the
            King's Pyland stable, which he set out to do. But then he realized that if the horse
            could only be hidden till after the Wessex Cup, his own horse Desborough would almost
            certainly win, so he changed his mind and turned back halfway; brought Silver Blaze down
            to his own stables. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>But I thought his stables had been thoroughly searched. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker><stageDirect>DISMISSIVE, AMUSED</stageDirect> Oh, an old
            horse-fakir like him has many a dodge.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>Ah, but aren't you afraid to leave the horse in his power now,
            since he has every interest in injuring it?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>My dear fellow, he'll guard it like the apple of his eye. He
            knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safely at the racetrack for the
            Wessex Cup. I made that perfectly clear to him. But I have a little trick to play on
            Colonel Ross. You may have noticed that his manner to me was just a trifle cavalier. So
            neither of us, please, for the present will say anything to him about the horse.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>Well, certainly not, if you wish it. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>And of course this is all quite a minor matter compared with
            the question of who killed John Straker.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>And you will devote yourself to that in the meantime? </ln>

            white splash on its forehead, or of the mottled off-foreleg. The Silver Blaze that won

            <sound>MOVING TRAIN INTERIOR BACKGROUND</sound>
        </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>I must confess that I even suspected Fitzroy Simpson myself for
            a time. It was only when I reached the trainer's house that the immense significance of
            the curried mutton occurred to me. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker>The curried mutton? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>You mean when you mentioned our Soho meal? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Exactly. Powdered opium has a disagreeable and perceptible
            flavor. Only something more strongly flavored -- like a curry -- could have disguised
            the taste. Now, Fitzroy Simpson could never have known that the maid would be serving
            the stable lad with a curry that night. The only people who could have known that were
            people in the house. So who could have taken advantage of the fact? Then there was the
            silence of the dog when the horse was taken from the stable. It failed to bark because
            it knew who the intruder was. I was already quite convinced that the intruder must have
            been John Straker himself. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker>John Straker himself?</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>But why did he wish to take Silver Blaze out onto the moor in
            the dead of night, and secretly? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>The answer to that was in John Straker's pocket. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>The dressmaker's bill? </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Precisely. Addressed to William Derbyshire. That set me
            thinking. Perhaps John Straker was leading a double life. After all, his wife confirmed
            that the expensive costume wasn't for her, and by recognizing the photo that I showed
            her, Madame Lesurier, the dressmaker, later confirmed that John Straker had indeed
            bought it there -- to give to a woman of more expensive tastes than his wife.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>In fact John Straker was leading a double life and was in bad
            financial straits. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker>John Straker?! I can scarcely believe it! </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>The knife gave me the final clue. It was a surgical knife --
            such as could be used to lame a horse without leaving any visible evidence of foul play.
            By laming Silver Blaze and betting on Desborough, John Straker would have been able to
            retrieve his fortune.</ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker>Oh, the scoundrel! A man I trusted! </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>He led the horse out onto the moor so that when he cut its
            tendon its plunging wouldn't waken the grooms overhead. In order that he could see what
            he was going to do, he needed a candle. So that the candle should not be seen, he led
            the horse to the hollow. In lighting the candle, he dropped that spent match in the mud.
            Unfortunately for him, the light must have scared the horse -- unless it was instinct.
            Whichever it was, the horse lashed out and its steel shoe caught Straker full in the
            forehead. He'd already taken off his mackintosh to be freer -- and, as he fell, gashed
            his thigh on his own knife. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>COLONEL</speaker><stageDirect>ASTONISHED</stageDirect> But, my dear fellow, you
            - you might have been there. Wonderful! </ln>

        <ln><speaker>WATSON</speaker>And the cravat? Fitzroy Simpson's, which was in the dead man's
            hand. </ln>

        <ln><speaker>HOLMES</speaker>Simpson said that he lost it; no doubt he did. Straker must
            have found it and picked it up, perhaps with the idea of using it to secure the horse's
            leg. Well, that disposes of everything. Quite simple. Perhaps we could while away the
